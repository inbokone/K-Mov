EXHUMA  💞 @ kissasian.one

4
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:03,372
Miss, we will be landing soon.

5
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,622
Would you like some more wine?

6
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:08,392
No, I'm all right.

7
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:11,032
And just so you know...

8
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:12,382
I'm Korean.

9
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:14,982
I understand. I apologize.

10
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,432
Have a pleasant flight.

11
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:34,240
Our representative...

12
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:37,702
Well, his main business is real estate.

13
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:39,698
He owns quite a lot of land in Korea,

14
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,922
and he also does investment business
across various places in the US.

15
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:44,875
Well, you know the sort of
people I'm talking about.

16
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:46,919
People who were born rich.

17
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:49,714
Exorbitantly rich people.

18
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:55,072
How am I supposed to trust them?

19
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,402
You should have considered my opinion, too.

20
00:01:57,872 --> 00:02:00,872
These are totally different circumstances.

21
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:03,882
I don't get it. Just do whatever you want.

22
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:20,161
He's calmed down now
because of the medication,

23
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:23,039
but he hasn't stopped crying
since he was born.

24
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,866
The renowned medical staff
has tried everything,

25
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:29,837
but they say there's nothing wrong
from a medical point of view.

26
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,798
We've already been informed.

27
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:43,113
Excuse me, could you leave us
alone in the room, please?

28
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:44,352
Excuse me?

29
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:53,532
<i> By the words of the Heavenly Venerable,
I summon the 9 inner spirits: </i>

30
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:55,833
<i> the celestial birth, the spirit
of absence, the mysterious pearl, </i>

31
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:58,032
<i> the central righteousness, the cinnabar
elixir, the spirit of cyclic change, </i>

32
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:00,202
<i> the elixir of the source of life,
the great abyss and the spirit of youth. </i>

33
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:01,503
<i> I call upon the 3 core essences: </i>

34
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,073
<i> the great brightness, the invigorating spirit
and the imperturbable essence. </i>

35
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:06,304
<i> When the 5 yin organs are disturbed,
when the 6 meridians are shaken, </i>

36
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:10,505
<i> when the limbs lose their harmony, when
the joints are in distress, recite this scripture. </i>

37
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,811
There must be other family members
suffering from the same illness.

38
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,521
The baby's father...

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,423
And the baby's grandfather.

40
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,992
Is she talking about my husband
and my father-in-law?

41
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:42,910
<i> The expressions on their faces... </i>

42
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,661
Yes.

43
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:48,348
<i> How they've changed from
suspicion to astonishment... </i>

44
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,411
<i> People always live in bright places,
and only look towards radiant ones. </i>

45
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:59,009
CHAPTER I: YIN-YANG
AND THE FIVE ELEMENTS

46
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,137
<i> The world must be bathed in bright light </i>

47
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:03,097
<i> for it to be visible to our eyes.</i>

48
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,974
<i> And people... </i>

49
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:08,519
<i> They believe only in the
things they can see and touch. </i>

50
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:13,858
<i> A world bathed in bright light... </i>

51
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:18,404
<i> And what lies beyond it. </i>

52
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:29,123
<i> People have known about those
dark beings since ancient times. </i>

53
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,872
<i> They've given them various names. </i>

54
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:36,589
<i> Ghosts, devils, goblins, monsters... </i>

55
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:41,010
<i> They ceaselessly yearn for
bright places, harboring envy, </i>

56
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:43,178
<i> so from time to time, </i>

57
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:45,723
<i> they resort to tricks to cross over. </i>

58
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:51,687
<i> And when that happens,
people come to me. </i>

59
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,359
<i> In between yin and yang, </i>

60
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,861
<i> in between science and superstition, </i>

61
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:02,822
<i> the people who find themselves
right in between these contrasts. </i>

62
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:05,743
<i> I am Lee Hwarim, a shaman. </i>

63
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:08,079
I received word from my wife.

64
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,622
I'm Park Ji-yong.

65
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:21,425
My older brother...

66
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:24,470
He ended up committing suicide
in a mental hospital.

67
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,681
Since then, I...

68
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:28,449
As well as...

69
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:32,478
...my newborn son, we've
been going through this.

70
00:05:33,104 --> 00:05:37,149
When I close my eyes,
someone screams.

71
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:39,068
And chokes me.

72
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,073
It's something the eldest
grandchildren experience.

73
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:47,535
At first they usually suspect
a hereditary disease.

74
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:50,913
Later on they suspect issues with the
house foundation and decide to move.

75
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:52,748
The shadow.

76
00:05:52,873 --> 00:05:55,459
As soon as I walked in, I
noticed a shadow in this house.

77
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:58,429
The shadow of one of your ancestors.

78
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:03,092
It's most likely the shadow of your grandfather.

79
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:04,599
My grandfather?

80
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,731
Simply put, it's deterioration of the grave.

81
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:10,348
It's usually referred to as a
misfortune related to the grave.

82
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,577
In other words, one of your ancestors

83
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:14,770
is complaining about the discomfort
he's experiencing.

84
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:16,897
Are you sure?

85
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:17,898
Yes.

86
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:19,458
One hundred percent.

87
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:22,862
Then...

88
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,698
What should I do?

89
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,493
You need to spend money and hire people.

90
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,203
I can't do it on my own.

91
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:33,789
We need to call in experts...

92
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:36,876
Damn it...

93
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,504
Their creepy faces already come to mind...

94
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:09,325
The grave has been opened!

95
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:10,910
The grave has been opened!

96
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:17,083
The deceased is waking up, stop staring.

97
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,376
Oh, we're sorry.

98
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:20,496
Let's go.

99
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:21,170
Come on, quickly.

100
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,216
One, two, three!

101
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,103
The water hasn't seeped in.

102
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:41,426
We apologize for waking you up.

103
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:43,818
Well, it's clean.

104
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:46,696
And fragrant.

105
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:49,240
Why did they put so much stuff in here?

106
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:52,118
All these...

107
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:53,703
Unbelievable.

108
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:56,428
I keep telling people not to
put metal objects inside.

109
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:58,434
Causing discomfort to the deceased...

110
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:01,502
Director Kim.

111
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:04,422
Your mother and all your
family elders resting here,

112
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:06,549
I've taken care of all of them, right?

113
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:08,467
Yes, you sure did.

114
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:13,472
And I assume everyone's healthy
and business is thriving.

115
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:15,141
Yes, all thanks to you.

116
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:19,061
Even if I dig up this place again...

117
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:24,067
This is one of the most auspicious burial sites
I've found in my 40-year career, you know that?

118
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:26,861
Look, the Five Elements
are in perfect harmony.

119
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:28,612
I'm telling you.

120
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,990
And I gave it to you cheap.

121
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,199
Damn it.

122
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:33,701
That's true...

123
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,787
So don't worry.

124
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:39,832
You're doing the right thing reburying her.

125
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:43,126
If you say it, then it must be so.

126
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:44,360
But...

127
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:46,672
Why does she keep appearing
in my children's dreams?

128
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:49,258
Lately, even my wife says she
sees her mother in her dreams.

129
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:51,302
Mortician Go!

130
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:53,471
Still not done?

131
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,885
Hey, I'm hungry.

132
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,059
So am I, and so is this person.

133
00:08:58,131 --> 00:09:00,853
The one in charge of the shrouding
didn't check, did he?

134
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,104
- Do the numbers match?
- Yes.

135
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:03,939
Very well.

136
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:20,388
Someone has taken Grandma's dentures.

137
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,735
I said someone is in possession
of Grandma's dentures.

138
00:09:36,764 --> 00:09:38,182
Did you...

139
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:40,850
Did you take Grandma's dentures?

140
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:42,159
Sang-hyun, you...

141
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,748
That thing in your closet...

142
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,022
Those were Grandma's dentures?!

143
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:47,410
But why would you...

144
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:49,735
All of Grandma's things were burned...

145
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,438
Now that Grandma's gone...

146
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,699
Dad...

147
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,951
I had to keep something...

148
00:09:56,952 --> 00:09:58,494
Little buddy!

149
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:00,955
Grandma says she's hungry,
you need to return them to her.

150
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:02,790
If I do...

151
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,626
Then how will I remember Grandma?

152
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:07,977
I don't have anything else
that belonged to her.

153
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,755
Did you say your name's Sang-hyun?

154
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:11,048
Sang-hyun...

155
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,758
Your Grandma...

156
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,511
...is always by your side.

157
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:25,287
<i> Blood ties. </i>

158
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,891
<i> They bind us, even beyond death. </i>

159
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,909
- Sis...
<i> - When individuals have common genes, </i>

160
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,195
<i> they share a common
body and a collective mind. </i>

161
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:38,701
<i> When the human body ends its activities,
it becomes dust and earth. </i>

162
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:43,581
<i> And we inhale that dust,
and tread on that earth. </i>

163
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:46,167
<i> Living, dying, and being reborn. </i>

164
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,377
<i> A cycle that repeats endlessly. </i>

165
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:49,628
<i> In other words, </i>

166
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:54,050
<i> the earth connects us and
makes everything circulate. </i>

167
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:58,220
<i> Those who call it superstition
or fraud, screw them all! </i>

168
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:00,733
<i> Because for the select 1%
who represent Korea's elite, </i>

169
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:03,133
<i> feng shui means both religion and science. </i>

170
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,421
<i> I'm a geomancer. </i>

171
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:11,519
<i> I find and dig up lands for both
the living and the dead. </i>

172
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,444
<i> My name is Kim Sang-deok
and I'm a feng shui expert. </i>

173
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:18,324
<i> A survey has revealed
that many domestic companies </i>

174
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:22,453
<i> perceive the current economic
situation as a long-term recession. </i>

175
00:11:22,454 --> 00:11:23,871
<i> According to the survey, Korea... </i>

176
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,040
Wait until it's cooked!

177
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:28,999
Why should I wait for it?

178
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,820
When it starts sizzling, it's just right.

179
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:33,005
To be honest, that place
we stopped by today...

180
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:34,423
That place...

181
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:37,760
- Is it really an auspicious burial site?
- What in the world...

182
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,929
What are you saying?
He's a regular client, after all.

183
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:42,473
But seeing that grave...

184
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:45,059
Well, the Black Tortoise up north
looked kind of ambiguous,

185
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,059
and the shape of the White
Tiger out west was...

186
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,687
I'm not really sure.

187
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:51,482
You think you're a feng shui expert now?

188
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:53,317
If you're so knowledgeable,

189
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:55,412
go ahead and do it
on your own from now on.

190
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,196
I've been thinking about something.

191
00:11:57,297 --> 00:12:01,409
In Korea, an average of 250,000
people die annually,

192
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:03,476
of which 30% are buried.

193
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:07,540
So starting from the Joseon dynasty,
in these narrow lands,

194
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,459
in every good spot, plenty of people
have already been buried.

195
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,964
So claiming that there are still
auspicious burial sites out there is...

196
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:17,425
- It's a bit...
- Well...

197
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,302
I'd give that burial site 65 points.

198
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:22,249
So not one hundred.

199
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,807
Now the seeds have dried,
they're long gone.

200
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:28,019
Listen, all the funeral directors like yourself

201
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,062
are working for funeral service companies,

202
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:32,898
while geomancers like me
who make a living digging up the earth,

203
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,817
they all end up working
on construction sites.

204
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:36,444
It's the final lap!

205
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:38,529
We are the last survivors.

206
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,698
- I'll pour you a drink.
- Hold on.

207
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:41,991
Did they arrive this quickly?

208
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:43,701
Oh my, you're early.

209
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:45,077
Hey, it's been a while.

210
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:46,329
- Hi.
- Hey.

211
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:47,330
- Come in.
- Sure.

212
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,581
Oh, my!

213
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:51,042
The scent of pine mushrooms
has reached Seoul.

214
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:53,169
- I must bear with it.
- He already ate them all.

215
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,046
What are you saying?

216
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,756
- How have you been?
- Welcome back.

217
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,174
I should have contacted you more often.

218
00:12:58,174 --> 00:12:59,800
It's all right, you're a busy man.

219
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,885
But...

220
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,511
Bong-gil has gotten even more handsome!

221
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:03,554
Oh, really?

222
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:05,014
That's right.

223
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:07,016
The girls always take him for walks.

224
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:08,392
It's becoming a bad habit.

225
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:10,019
How long has it been?

226
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,979
- About 3 years?
- Yes.

227
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:13,189
Time flies.

228
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:14,440
So...

229
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,233
How's business going these days?

230
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,985
So-so.

231
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,763
- It's off-season now.
- So here I am,

232
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:23,366
- visiting the elders again...
- Wait a minute.

233
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:25,993
I smell something.

234
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:27,495
Don't you smell anything?

235
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:30,081
What kind of smell?
The smell of money?

236
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:32,583
Yeah, I think that's what it smells like.

237
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:34,669
Damn it...

238
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,921
I tried to hide it, but...

239
00:13:37,838 --> 00:13:38,756
You got me.

240
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:42,885
Come on, spill the beans.

241
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:45,971
How did he catch on so fast?

242
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,437
After a trusted doctor introduced them to me,

243
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:56,607
I visited a strange family living in the US.

244
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:58,859
Someone named Park Ji-yong.

245
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:01,445
His family lineage is Korean up to his father,

246
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:03,948
but from him onward, they
have American nationality.

247
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,616
Simply put, he's...

248
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:07,284
Rich, filthy rich.

249
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:08,995
That's a good start!

250
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:12,707
The eldest grandchildren
suffer from spiritual illnesses.

251
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:13,791
Even a newborn.

252
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,418
Oh, boy...

253
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,336
He endured it for quite a while.

254
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:19,380
Isn't it possession?

255
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,757
Hasn't reached that point yet.

256
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:24,218
From what I've seen...

257
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:27,096
It's deterioration of the grave.

258
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:33,882
Are you really gonna dig up
your grandfather's grave?

259
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:38,252
It's been almost one hundred years.

260
00:14:38,722 --> 00:14:40,622
I don't need your approval.

261
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:42,672
I've made up my mind.

262
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:48,362
You really believe in such things?

263
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:52,492
And you think your aunt
in Korea will agree on this?

264
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:57,532
I'm the head of the family.

265
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:00,192
So I make the decisions.

266
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,509
First of all, I don't trust those people.

267
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,596
If something goes wrong,
things will only get worse.

268
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:10,848
The baby will get better soon.

269
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,935
Let's pray together,

270
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:17,730
and continue the treatment.

271
00:15:29,492 --> 00:15:31,035
We just...

272
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:34,580
All we need to do is live
quietly and away from it all.

273
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:57,853
Why would it matter if her belly
shows during the wedding?

274
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,722
There's no better dowry than that!

275
00:15:59,723 --> 00:16:01,857
But still. Me having a grandson?

276
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:03,509
Not to mention that
he'll have blonde hair.

277
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,112
And his blue eyes will
glow like headlights!

278
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:07,613
What an outdated mindset.

279
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:10,533
But will Yeon-hee continue living
in Germany after getting married?

280
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:13,786
What are you talking about?
She has to live in Korea.

281
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:15,496
Speaking of which...

282
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:20,167
I was somewhat worried about money,
given Yeon-hee's marriage,

283
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,878
- but we've landed a major catch this time.
- That's right.

284
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:24,505
Our Savior,

285
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:29,093
he even takes care of my
pension at the right moment.

286
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,094
Amen!

287
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,616
But how rich is this guy,

288
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:37,226
that he's paying us 500 million won each
to relocate the grave?

289
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:39,478
You think that's all?
He likely paid more.

290
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:40,688
What? More?

291
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:44,191
You know how cunning Hwarim is.

292
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:45,818
You think she didn't secure
a little extra for herself?

293
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,403
That's true.

294
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:50,990
She seems naive but she's not.

295
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:59,623
First of all, I'd like you to tell me
your grandfather's name and his hometown.

296
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:06,172
Typically I inquire about the reputation
of the family members as well as their jobs,

297
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:08,462
but since you said it's urgent...

298
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:13,679
Shouldn't the person receiving the money
be the one to prove he's trustworthy?

299
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:17,892
Oh...

300
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:19,894
Trust?

301
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:21,854
Fine, then.

302
00:17:21,985 --> 00:17:25,066
If you don't want to do this,
let's just forget about the whole thing.

303
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:27,526
Would you please follow just two things?

304
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:30,863
Please ensure that today's events remain private.

305
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:33,908
And please carry out the cremation right away.

306
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:38,130
With the coffin intact.

307
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:39,621
Intact?

308
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:41,831
You're saying not to open it at all?

309
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:43,459
Does it make any difference?

310
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,878
Even if you relocate it,

311
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:47,838
it still ends up being cremated anyhow.

312
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:49,840
Listen to me.

313
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,010
Usually this needs to be reported
to the district office first.

314
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:56,889
After the coffin is opened, the
funeral director gathers the remains,

315
00:17:56,889 --> 00:18:00,434
then it needs to be moved
to another location to be cremated.

316
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:01,852
Do you understand?

317
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:07,858
Anyway, for now...

318
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:09,986
Let's see the burial site first.

319
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,364
My parents and the other relatives
are quite against it,

320
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,760
so I'd like to get it over with
as soon as possible...

321
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,471
I said let's see the burial site first.

322
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:22,426
CHAPTER II: UNNAMED GRAVE

323
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:24,834
It's in the northern part of Gangwon Province...

324
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:27,128
That's rather unsettling.

325
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:29,380
But the fact that we can't open the coffin,

326
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,382
that's pretty strange.

327
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:34,260
Shouldn't we be checking the remains?

328
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:38,137
This means the shrouding
is out of the question.

329
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:41,225
Could there be something in the coffin?

330
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:44,302
BOGUKSA TEMPLE

331
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:33,129
Have you ever seen a grave on top of a mountain?

332
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:34,714
It's uncommon.

333
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:38,170
Do you know this mountain?

334
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,219
It's my first time here.

335
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:43,806
For someone who has traveled
to every corner of the country,

336
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,183
are there still places
you're not familiar with?

337
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:49,486
Because I only look
for the auspicious ones.

338
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,751
The dragon's energy
stretches out far and wide!

339
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:54,960
Good.

340
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,779
Even North Korea is
visible from here. See?

341
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,146
You can see North Korea.

342
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:05,813
The grave looks plain
compared to its surroundings.

343
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:39,880
Is there anything written there?

344
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:43,300
It's unnamed.

345
00:22:54,562 --> 00:22:59,025
Could you please tell me
who suggested this burial site?

346
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:01,402
A famous monk at the time.

347
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:03,946
In recognition of my grandfather's
great contributions to the country,

348
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:07,408
he told my father that he found the
most auspicious burial site for him.

349
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:08,993
A monk?

350
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:09,910
Yes.

351
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,455
His Buddhist name was Gisune.

352
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:14,206
Gisune?

353
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:16,584
A very bizarre Buddhist name.

354
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:20,212
But the grave looks quite plain.

355
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:22,882
Grave robbers were rampant in those days,

356
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:26,426
so I heard he was sent off
quietly in an unassuming manner.

357
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:37,188
What do you think?

358
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:39,440
Shall we set the date right away?

359
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:44,612
What's wrong?

360
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:51,202
Sir...

361
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:55,122
I'm afraid I can't carry out this task.

362
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,294
Here we go again.

363
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:01,462
Sang-deok!

364
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:04,340
- Who's he to decide?
- What's going on?

365
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,467
Is it that bad?

366
00:24:07,134 --> 00:24:09,853
Isn't there some way to figure this out?

367
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:12,932
Why aren't you saying anything?

368
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,019
But...

369
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:20,022
The mountain's shape is fine,
so what's the problem?

370
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:23,609
Have you forgotten how much
this deal is worth?

371
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,488
Sir, why are you doing this?

372
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:32,159
You guys know all too well...

373
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,120
...what happens when you disturb
a grave that shouldn't be meddled with.

374
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:37,665
I've been digging up lands
for a living for 40 years,

375
00:24:37,665 --> 00:24:40,084
but this grave is like nothing
I've ever seen before.

376
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:42,419
It's the most ominous place imaginable.

377
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,799
A person should never be buried in a
place like this under any circumstances.

378
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,552
If we mess with the wrong thing
in a place like that,

379
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:53,722
everyone from the geomancer down to
the laborers will die one by one!

380
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:55,280
Don't chime in unless you know
what you're talking about.

381
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:57,476
Hwarim, you've seen the foxes, too.

382
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:03,566
Foxes and graves don't mix,
it makes no sense.

383
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,178
It's the most ominous place of them all.

384
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:21,375
That was the last time I saw my son smiling.

385
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:23,294
The truth is...

386
00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:25,212
I had two children before him,

387
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:27,381
but both ended in miscarriages
for unknown reasons,

388
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:29,592
so he was conceived late in life
after much effort.

389
00:25:31,344 --> 00:25:33,846
Professor Kim, do you have any children?

390
00:25:33,938 --> 00:25:36,015
Yes, I do.

391
00:25:36,015 --> 00:25:38,809
I have a daughter who's getting married soon.

392
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,645
Congratulations.

393
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:42,647
No need for that...

394
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:45,066
Is your daughter in a similar line of work?

395
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:47,985
My daughter majored in aerospace engineering at KAIST,

396
00:25:47,985 --> 00:25:50,821
and now she works for an airline in Germany.

397
00:25:51,113 --> 00:25:54,116
But now that she's getting married,
it's all chaos.

398
00:25:54,716 --> 00:25:55,618
Interesting.

399
00:25:56,452 --> 00:25:59,997
The father is a geomancer, while
the daughter is an aerospace engineer...

400
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:01,290
Here's the thing.

401
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,627
If you carefully analyze these two fields,

402
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:08,214
you'll find many similar aspects.

403
00:26:08,214 --> 00:26:09,714
The concept of the Five Elements,

404
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:14,427
it takes the earth as the starting point
and includes water, fire, metal and wood,

405
00:26:14,428 --> 00:26:17,473
which are studied as the essential
elements constituting nature.

406
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:20,184
- And when it comes to aerospace engineering...
- Then...

407
00:26:22,353 --> 00:26:24,438
Please, save my son.

408
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,737
Mr. Park Ji-yong, are you
keeping something from us?

409
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:38,244
- What do you mean?
- 38.3417°,

410
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,496
128.3189°.

411
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:42,123
Latitude and longitude.

412
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:44,792
The numbers engraved on the back of the gravestone.

413
00:26:45,084 --> 00:26:47,336
That monk named Gisune...

414
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:50,172
I don't know who that fellow is,

415
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,023
but he was unnervingly accurate.

416
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,718
Evidently he had a clear purpose.

417
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:01,726
No...

418
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:03,477
I don't know.

419
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,564
And I'm not hiding anything from any of you.

420
00:27:06,564 --> 00:27:09,025
I'll say this again.

421
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:13,904
Relocating the grave from such a peculiar
and ominous place is extremely dangerous.

422
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:16,181
It's like digging up a landmine
with your bare hands.

423
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:19,199
Let's substitute the negative
energy through a ritual.

424
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:22,872
I knew it.

425
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:27,918
We'll perform the ritual and
relocate the grave simultaneously.

426
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:31,005
Why are you acting like this?
You already knew the answer.

427
00:27:31,422 --> 00:27:33,966
I don't believe in things I haven't tried.

428
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:36,568
Although it would be the first time doing
the ritual while relocating the grave,

429
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:39,254
in theory, it's not impossible.

430
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:40,556
Wait a minute.

431
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:45,853
Why are we asking Professor Kim
for permission?

432
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,380
It's not like he's the only geomancer in Korea.

433
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:51,041
That's why it's hard to work with old geezers.

434
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:51,442
Hey...

435
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:54,478
Look, he says his child is sick. Okay?

436
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:04,997
This hotel has good positioning.

437
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:08,209
- Good.
- Let's go!

438
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:12,088
<i> It's a sort of deceitful ritual,
also called "redirecting the misfortune". </i>

439
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:16,842
<i> First, we create a connection between 5 workers
born in the year of the Pig and 5 pigs, </i>

440
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,054
<i> then we let the 5 men dig up the grave. </i>

441
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:23,641
<i> The principle is to direct the negative energy
emerging from the earth towards the 5 animals, </i>

442
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:25,935
<i> which I will then dissipate. </i>

443
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,871
Your aunt is here.

444
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:34,521
It seems like your mother shared what's happening.

445
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:15,461
<i> In the year of the Water Tiger, </i>

446
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:20,381
<i> on the new moon of October, </i>

447
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:24,621
<i> I, Go Young-geun, </i>

448
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:28,340
<i> respectfully stand in the presence of </i>

449
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:32,651
<i> the deceased Mr. Park from Miryang. </i>

450
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:36,811
<i> May the spirits grant protection. </i>

451
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:41,101
<i> Let there be no future hardships. </i>

452
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:43,961
<i> Please accept these offerings. </i>

453
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:54,791
<i> 33 realms of the heavenly palace,
28 constellations of the earthly palace </i>

454
00:29:54,831 --> 00:30:00,441
<i> In the 33 realms where all Buddhas and
heavenly beings dwell, everything aligns </i>

455
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:08,411
<i> Our great ancestor ascended to the throne
after the founding of the Joseon dynasty </i>

456
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:14,061
<i> Our foundation faces southward,
in alignment with the solar noon </i>

457
00:30:14,101 --> 00:30:19,381
<i> Mount Gwanak is our guide,
Mount Inwang becomes the Azure Dragon </i>

458
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:23,271
<i> Stretching ten thousand li to the east,
behold the White Tiger! </i>

459
00:30:30,231 --> 00:30:31,771
Let's go!

460
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:41,931
Let's go!

461
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,301
Let's go!

462
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:58,781
Let's go!

463
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:21,021
Very good!

464
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:30,991
- Up the mountain!
- Up the mountain!

465
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:38,941
Exhumation!

466
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:41,181
Exhumation!

467
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:43,481
Exhumation!

468
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,491
There it is.

469
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:42,401
The grave has been opened!

470
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:44,401
The grave has been opened!

471
00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:51,469
Thank you for your hard work.

472
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:53,721
My goodness.

473
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,935
The cold here is brutal.

474
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:18,621
It's been so long, it's barely visible.

475
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:36,639
Wait, what is this?

476
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:39,183
Hey, it's a juniper wood coffin!

477
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:41,811
In the past, only the royal
family used this kind of wood.

478
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:43,299
We had something like this here?

479
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,063
For real?

480
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:48,275
Lifting the coffin!

481
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,822
Yes, that's good.

482
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:54,706
Just like that. With a little more strength!

483
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:55,533
Lower it.

484
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:57,806
- Slowly, slowly.
- Lower.

485
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,246
The coffin must be loaded intact
into the hearse.

486
00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:01,992
We're going straight to the crematorium.

487
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:05,251
You fellas bury the gravestone
and wrap up everything here.

488
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:07,628
Let's change the ropes.

489
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:09,128
And don't eat meat today.

490
00:35:09,228 --> 00:35:11,298
Yes.

491
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:19,539
I'm leaving after handling it
with consideration.

492
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:28,566
Yes.

493
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:32,152
A deceased person lies inside
and we can't even shroud his corpse.

494
00:35:32,153 --> 00:35:33,362
Let's at least show him the proper respect.

495
00:35:33,779 --> 00:35:35,781
Gosh...

496
00:35:36,073 --> 00:35:39,201
I'm the man who even shrouded
the corpse of an ex-president.

497
00:35:39,535 --> 00:35:42,333
It's all over now. Loosen up, okay?

498
00:35:57,594 --> 00:35:58,721
Let's see...

499
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:01,682
There's nothing there.

500
00:36:01,682 --> 00:36:02,975
Let's go.

501
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:13,961
What's this?

502
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:14,654
Shit!

503
00:37:02,618 --> 00:37:04,412
What is this?

504
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:07,039
Unbelievable.

505
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:21,512
- I'll talk to him.
- Then I'll call the director.

506
00:37:25,558 --> 00:37:26,559
Mr. Park.

507
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:28,879
It suddenly started
raining out of the blue,

508
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:31,272
so we'll have to delay
the cremation for a while.

509
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:33,816
How come?

510
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,841
It's not like we're cremating him outdoors.

511
00:37:35,842 --> 00:37:39,488
If cremated on a rainy day,

512
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,491
the deceased won't be able
to depart to a good place.

513
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:45,661
Call it superstition if you want,

514
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:48,555
but I'm telling you this as a
matter of professional ethics.

515
00:37:50,169 --> 00:37:52,752
These things do happen sometimes, yes.

516
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,211
In such cases,

517
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:57,423
the remains are placed at
the morgue of a nearby hospital,

518
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,384
and the cremation is scheduled
for the next auspicious day.

519
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,347
If we go to the hospital, won't
we have to file a funeral report?

520
00:38:04,405 --> 00:38:05,639
Sang-deok!

521
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,899
Sang-deok, I just got off the phone,
it's all taken care of!

522
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,219
You can go straight away!

523
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:10,853
Don't worry about that.

524
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:13,163
We're acquainted with the staff there.

525
00:38:16,768 --> 00:38:19,403
What do you mean by bringing an
unopened coffin after relocating the grave?

526
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:22,114
Apparently the chief mourner
doesn't allow us to open it.

527
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,618
- Here you go.
- Oh, no need.

528
00:38:25,753 --> 00:38:27,119
What in the world?

529
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:28,191
What's wrong with you?

530
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:31,666
- Take it, quickly.
- Gosh...

531
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:35,002
The last team just left today, so it's quiet.

532
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,712
Oh, that's good.

533
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,465
My goodness... Rain on the cremation day...

534
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:42,510
It's difficult for him to depart
for the other world.

535
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:53,896
- Do we need to set a new date?
- Yes.

536
00:38:55,147 --> 00:38:57,858
But can you really trust those people?

537
00:38:58,067 --> 00:39:01,361
I gave them just enough and
told them only what was necessary.

538
00:39:01,362 --> 00:39:03,355
There is no need for concern.

539
00:39:03,823 --> 00:39:06,283
Now that we have some time,

540
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:10,913
let's think of a way to bury him
peacefully at the Yeoju Cemetery.

541
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:14,875
I'm still against the idea of cremating him.

542
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:18,546
He's my father, so I have the right to decide.

543
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:21,716
Go get some rest for now.

544
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:29,657
Since you're not allowed to open the coffin,

545
00:39:29,776 --> 00:39:31,534
you can just leave it here.

546
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:34,353
I just need to set the humidity.

547
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:35,643
Thank you.

548
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:38,279
Wow... This coffin...

549
00:39:39,275 --> 00:39:42,444
The deceased must have held
a high position in the government.

550
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,988
- How have you been?
- Hey, it's been a while.

551
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:49,076
The chief mourner and the rest of
the family have all gone back to Seoul.

552
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:52,872
Hwarim says she's on her way here.

553
00:39:53,626 --> 00:39:55,458
Since it's freezing outside,

554
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,877
you should go and have
a bowl of hot soup.

555
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:01,088
I'll be back after going somewhere.

556
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:02,465
All right.

557
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:25,502
BOGUKSA TEMPLE

558
00:40:56,952 --> 00:41:00,142
I don't think we've met before.
How may I help you?

559
00:41:00,143 --> 00:41:01,691
Oh, excuse me.

560
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:06,320
I was passing by and saw
the sign on the road.

561
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,739
Oh, I see.

562
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:09,985
I'm here because...

563
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:13,155
The sign for Boguksa Temple is
marked with a feng shui symbol.

564
00:41:13,156 --> 00:41:15,621
It seemed a bit strange,
so I thought I'd stop by.

565
00:41:17,564 --> 00:41:18,791
Are you a geomancer?

566
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,167
Yes.

567
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:23,337
I was a disciple of Master Choi Eui-jung.

568
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,866
Even though currently I'm barely making
a living on my own by digging the earth.

569
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,978
It may look worn out now,

570
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:32,805
but this place has been around
for over 100 years.

571
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:36,642
The head monk who first
built this temple here

572
00:41:36,642 --> 00:41:40,604
was very skilled in feng shui
and made quite a name for himself.

573
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,356
Oh, I see.

574
00:41:42,437 --> 00:41:45,526
I can tell just by looking at this place.

575
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:46,902
So, I was wondering...

576
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:50,064
The name of that head monk...

577
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:52,482
Is it Gisune, by any chance?

578
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:54,118
Gisune?

579
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,579
No, he was Venerable Wonbong.

580
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:59,582
But why do you ask?

581
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:00,750
Ah...

582
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:04,503
On top of that mountain over there,

583
00:42:04,795 --> 00:42:07,048
there is an unnamed grave.

584
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:10,051
- Do you happen to know anything about...
- Of course.

585
00:42:10,468 --> 00:42:13,053
I'm not sure if it's still talked about,

586
00:42:13,054 --> 00:42:16,713
but I heard numerous rumors
a long time ago.

587
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:20,853
What kind of rumors?

588
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:22,772
Instead of sitting alone in the dark,

589
00:42:22,772 --> 00:42:25,399
why don't you go across the street
and have a bowl of beef soup?

590
00:42:25,497 --> 00:42:26,817
Sure, don't worry.

591
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:29,004
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- Good job. See you.

592
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:35,618
Why do they always insist
on deciding the menu for me?

593
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:47,296
<i> There was a rumor of a treasure
buried inside that grave. </i>

594
00:42:47,963 --> 00:42:49,423
<i> A treasure? </i>

595
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:54,755
Another rumor claimed that the grave belonged
to the wealthiest man from the Joseon era.

596
00:42:54,756 --> 00:42:57,722
There were also rumors suggesting
it was an unknown royal tomb.

597
00:42:57,723 --> 00:43:01,811
That's why, in the past, many grave
robbers were lurking around it.

598
00:43:02,937 --> 00:43:04,188
Grave robbers?

599
00:43:04,362 --> 00:43:06,774
But they were all suddenly captured, and...

600
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,154
Apparently a few of them crossed the
border to the North, or something.

601
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:12,387
So in the end, they failed to rob it?

602
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,503
They likely didn't even get
a chance to attempt it.

603
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:17,118
Perhaps due to being a high-ranking
person's grave, it was heavily guarded.

604
00:43:17,118 --> 00:43:18,945
I heard they couldn't even get close to it.

605
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:21,580
These are...

606
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,750
The tools those people left behind.

607
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:32,925
But...

608
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:35,344
Why are you asking about that grave?

609
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,808
Today, I...

610
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:44,411
...dug up that grave.

611
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:52,236
And well?

612
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,739
Was there a treasure buried there?

613
00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:11,672
Excuse me!

614
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:13,299
What are you doing?

615
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:14,675
Hey!

616
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:21,849
Professor...

617
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:22,933
Professor!

618
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:24,185
Hey!

619
00:44:24,902 --> 00:44:29,902
CHAPTER III: SPIRIT

620
00:44:31,108 --> 00:44:32,234
What?

621
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:33,361
What do you mean?

622
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:34,820
The coffin has been opened?

623
00:44:36,171 --> 00:44:38,168
He and his damned hands...

624
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:40,232
I've given him plenty, he really
shouldn't be doing things like that.

625
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:42,252
No wonder he's got such an off-putting stare.

626
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,247
Oh...

627
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:46,666
What happened?

628
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,060
Something passed by her side.

629
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:52,538
What exactly passed by?

630
00:45:02,348 --> 00:45:04,517
Something came out of there.

631
00:45:05,112 --> 00:45:06,560
Something very threatening.

632
00:45:45,673 --> 00:45:48,352
Dad...

633
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:54,233
My dad...

634
00:45:58,237 --> 00:46:00,114
Jong-soon...

635
00:46:01,198 --> 00:46:03,367
My son...

636
00:46:04,994 --> 00:46:07,663
Open up for me, please.

637
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:11,500
Dad...

638
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:16,839
Come in.

639
00:46:45,207 --> 00:46:46,994
Dad...

640
00:47:23,136 --> 00:47:28,744
Our smart little puppy...

641
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:35,167
Here it flows with milk and honey,

642
00:47:36,627 --> 00:47:42,675
while your father is hungry and cold.

643
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:45,428
Forgive me...

644
00:48:48,824 --> 00:48:51,827
<i> The spirit is probably wandering
wildly at this very moment. </i>

645
00:48:51,827 --> 00:48:53,746
<i> The chief mourner will be in danger. </i>

646
00:48:53,746 --> 00:48:57,124
Professor, please go to Seoul
quickly ahead of me.

647
00:48:57,223 --> 00:49:00,294
Meanwhile, we will summon
the spirit back here.

648
00:49:00,294 --> 00:49:03,021
Hold on, are you going to
summon it back here?

649
00:49:03,134 --> 00:49:05,549
For a century it wailed
from beneath the ground,

650
00:49:05,549 --> 00:49:07,593
yet no one pulled it out.

651
00:49:08,052 --> 00:49:10,679
The spirit harbors nothing but hatred.

652
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,933
It will hunt down all of its relatives.

653
00:49:21,412 --> 00:49:23,359
Talk about a mood killer...

654
00:49:23,466 --> 00:49:25,945
Outside it's raining, the coffin lid
gets opened, a ghost comes out...

655
00:49:26,092 --> 00:49:27,780
I really don't wanna do this...

656
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:30,408
What on earth is going on?

657
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,579
Is it all right to do this on the same
day as the energy redirecting ritual?

658
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,332
It's fine.

659
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:41,585
Elder Go, you must get the timing right.

660
00:49:41,794 --> 00:49:44,296
- You need to take hold of it as soon as it enters.
- Got it.

661
00:49:58,031 --> 00:50:01,331
<i> In the Sahā world of endurance,
the land of all living things. </i>

662
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:05,031
<i> The Joseon Dynasty of the
East Sea, the Republic of Korea. </i>

663
00:50:05,071 --> 00:50:08,071
<i> Gangwon Province, 26 Bureaus; </i>

664
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:11,481
<i> The county is Goseong, </i>

665
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:15,231
<i> and the township is Jukwang. </i>

666
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:21,131
<i> We've come to officiate the rites
for the deceased of the Park family. </i>

667
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:22,481
<i> At the first altar,
five spirits; </i>

668
00:50:22,482 --> 00:50:23,781
<i> At the second altar,
one thousand catties; </i>

669
00:50:23,782 --> 00:50:27,561
<i> At the third altar is the soul-summoning
space, please return quickly. </i>

670
00:50:27,562 --> 00:50:30,791
<i> Return to the space between
the physical and spiritual world, </i>

671
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:34,391
<i> return to the space between life and death. </i>

672
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:38,321
Come, come quickly!

673
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:46,961
<i> Is it perhaps difficult to return
due to the water being too deep? </i>

674
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:52,761
<i> Or is it due to an illness that you
are bedridden and unable to return? </i>

675
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:53,511
<i> You should... </i>

676
00:51:01,874 --> 00:51:05,336
<i> If you can't return because you have
no clothes, return wearing mourning clothes. </i>

677
00:51:05,336 --> 00:51:08,047
<i> If you can't return because you have
no crutches, return using a bamboo cane. </i>

678
00:51:08,047 --> 00:51:11,967
<i> If you can't return because you have
no shoes, return wearing straw shoes. </i>

679
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:16,180
<i> If you can't return because you're thirsty,
return after drinking 3 glasses of alcohol. </i>

680
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,933
<i> If you can't return because you have no dwelling,
you are welcome at the shaman's residence. </i>

681
00:51:18,933 --> 00:51:21,133
<i> If you can't return because
your body has decayed, </i>

682
00:51:21,134 --> 00:51:23,104
<i> let your spirit grab onto
the pine needle branch. </i>

683
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:25,064
<i> If you can't return
because you can't speak, </i>

684
00:51:25,064 --> 00:51:27,808
<i> borrow the shaman's voice
and return, even if only for a moment. </i>

685
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:30,277
<i> Reflecting on the past and present, </i>

686
00:51:30,277 --> 00:51:33,990
<i> we all get gray hair and the
only inevitable thing is death. </i>

687
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,283
Possess him!

688
00:51:36,283 --> 00:51:39,245
Yes, it's coming, it's on its way!

689
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:46,920
- It possessed him, he's possessed!
- Bong-gil!

690
00:51:47,014 --> 00:51:48,500
Let it in!

691
00:52:24,213 --> 00:52:25,333
Grandpa...

692
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,127
Who are you?

693
00:52:29,253 --> 00:52:30,254
Well?

694
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:33,148
Bong-gil, don't let it escape!

695
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:37,219
Oh, dear...

696
00:52:37,703 --> 00:52:39,722
What made you feel so wronged?

697
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:41,432
Let's hear it.

698
00:52:41,794 --> 00:52:43,089
- Well?
- Shit...

699
00:52:43,142 --> 00:52:46,269
Vent out all your repressed anger
here today before you leave.

700
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,856
Don't go anywhere else.

701
00:52:49,982 --> 00:52:52,026
My kin...

702
00:52:52,735 --> 00:52:54,487
I'm taking them with me.

703
00:52:57,701 --> 00:53:00,076
You can't do that.

704
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,137
We've lost it.

705
00:53:28,854 --> 00:53:30,147
What do we do now?

706
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:38,906
Hello?

707
00:53:39,438 --> 00:53:41,088
Ah, it's me, Kim Sang-deok, sir.

708
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:42,535
Is everything all right?

709
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:44,370
Yes.

710
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,080
How may I help you?

711
00:53:46,227 --> 00:53:47,790
Oh, I'm glad.

712
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,209
Well, something came up, and...

713
00:53:50,301 --> 00:53:52,369
I'm rushing over to you right now.

714
00:53:52,852 --> 00:53:54,962
I know it's late, but can
we talk for a moment?

715
00:53:55,022 --> 00:53:55,881
Sure.

716
00:53:56,757 --> 00:53:58,259
What's going on?

717
00:53:59,211 --> 00:54:02,346
Mr. Park Ji-yong, you are staying
at the same hotel as before, right?

718
00:54:02,463 --> 00:54:03,990
Yes, I'm almost there.

719
00:54:04,076 --> 00:54:06,022
I'll head up shortly.

720
00:54:06,102 --> 00:54:07,184
Hold on.

721
00:54:07,736 --> 00:54:08,811
Who is it?

722
00:54:08,963 --> 00:54:10,514
Yes, it's me, Kim Sang-deok!

723
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,108
What?

724
00:54:12,188 --> 00:54:13,399
Hello?

725
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:15,401
What is it? What happened?

726
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,491
Professor Kim, are you already at the door?

727
00:54:17,551 --> 00:54:19,405
Excuse me! Director Park!

728
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:21,819
Ah, no, no, no! No!

729
00:54:21,939 --> 00:54:23,207
That's not me.

730
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:25,499
This is happening because your
grandfather's coffin has been opened.

731
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,551
Mr. Park Ji-yong!

732
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:28,314
It's an urgent matter,
please open the door!

733
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:30,443
- My grandfather's coffin?
- Ah, yes...

734
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:32,490
I apologize for the way
things have developed.

735
00:54:32,491 --> 00:54:34,157
Has anything happened inside?

736
00:54:34,158 --> 00:54:35,345
With that said,

737
00:54:35,346 --> 00:54:37,674
do not open that door under any
circumstances and stay still.

738
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:39,300
- I'm almost there.
- Mr. Park Ji-yong!

739
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,917
From this moment on,

740
00:54:40,918 --> 00:54:43,478
you must follow only my
instructions and remain calm.

741
00:54:44,205 --> 00:54:45,890
Mr. Park Ji-yong, listen carefully.

742
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:49,268
Move away from the door and
take shelter near the window.

743
00:54:51,479 --> 00:54:52,820
Open the door, first.

744
00:54:53,558 --> 00:54:55,979
It's urgent, I need to explain the
situation to you as soon as possible!

745
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,257
Don't answer him.

746
00:54:57,258 --> 00:54:58,770
Don't even listen to him!

747
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:01,217
First, go to the window and open it.

748
00:55:01,283 --> 00:55:02,979
Your grandfather will protect you,

749
00:55:03,052 --> 00:55:04,406
you just have to let him in.

750
00:55:04,407 --> 00:55:06,173
Excuse me! Mr. Park!

751
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,120
Trust me! Hurry up!

752
00:55:12,006 --> 00:55:14,377
Open it!

753
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,501
Mr. Park Ji-yong!

754
00:56:00,913 --> 00:56:02,008
Mr. Park Ji-yong.

755
00:56:07,972 --> 00:56:08,848
Are you all right?

756
00:56:15,953 --> 00:56:18,649
Admirable young people of the peninsula!

757
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,362
Do you hear the roar of
hundreds of planes and cannons?

758
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:26,449
March forth, sons of the Empire!

759
00:56:27,735 --> 00:56:32,187
Lift your silver guns and swords in
the radiant glow of the Rising Sun Flag!

760
00:56:32,663 --> 00:56:35,315
For the new unity
of Greater East Asia,

761
00:56:35,624 --> 00:56:40,095
offer your very beings
to the great Empire!

762
00:56:51,807 --> 00:56:52,850
Ambulance...

763
00:56:53,184 --> 00:56:54,810
Call an ambulance...

764
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,188
Please call an ambulance.

765
00:56:57,244 --> 00:56:58,230
Okay?

766
00:56:58,606 --> 00:57:00,232
Call an ambulance!

767
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:08,569
I saw it with my own eyes!

768
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:10,848
If we just stand by, it'll be
one funeral after another.

769
00:57:10,849 --> 00:57:12,912
- I'm going to the crematorium!
- Okay, go!

770
00:57:12,972 --> 00:57:16,415
And you need to get the cremation
consent, I'll be right there on standby.

771
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,687
Right now...

772
00:57:38,229 --> 00:57:41,815
- Your grandfather's coffin has been...
- The fox has broken the tiger's spine.

773
00:57:42,717 --> 00:57:43,901
Excuse me?

774
00:57:50,457 --> 00:57:53,017
The fox has broken the tiger's spine.

775
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:09,468
I said the fox has broken the tiger's spine.

776
00:58:36,977 --> 00:58:37,913
Mother-in-law.

777
00:58:38,003 --> 00:58:40,207
Are you not feeling well?

778
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:43,919
She must be worn out from
her trip to the countryside.

779
00:58:45,171 --> 00:58:47,214
I need to rest for a bit.

780
00:58:53,312 --> 00:58:56,662
Joseph's condition seems to be
better today, doesn't it?

781
00:58:56,712 --> 00:59:00,632
Eunice, I cannot reach anyone at home,
so I'll go back home and check.

782
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:02,832
Sure, I'll be here.

783
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,593
Buddy, I'm asking you this
because it's urgent!

784
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:11,921
When have I ever asked you
for such a favor?

785
00:59:11,922 --> 00:59:13,336
Bro, now is really not the time!

786
00:59:13,337 --> 00:59:15,836
I'll be there shortly,
so please hurry, will you?

787
00:59:15,837 --> 00:59:18,316
And with this rain pouring down,
what's this about a cremation?

788
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:19,255
What does the chief mourner
have to say about this?

789
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,457
Something's come out of the coffin, man!

790
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:23,334
You get what I'm saying, right?

791
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,461
It needs to be cremated immediately.

792
00:59:26,115 --> 00:59:28,047
Please contact the family
in the US right away.

793
00:59:28,048 --> 00:59:29,048
Excuse me?

794
00:59:29,438 --> 00:59:30,371
What do you mean?

795
00:59:30,457 --> 00:59:31,835
You saw it too.

796
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:34,311
The baby is the next one in danger.

797
00:59:34,595 --> 00:59:37,403
<i> On the treetop, </i>

798
00:59:37,516 --> 00:59:39,887
<i> when the wind blows, </i>

799
00:59:39,947 --> 00:59:42,561
<i> the cradle will rock. </i>

800
00:59:42,937 --> 00:59:45,356
<i> When the bough breaks, </i>

801
00:59:45,356 --> 00:59:48,776
<i> the cradle will fall, </i>

802
00:59:49,026 --> 00:59:52,834
<i> and down will come baby, </i>

803
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,117
<i> cradle, and all. </i>

804
01:00:01,261 --> 01:00:03,874
No one is answering the phone
at the US residence.

805
01:00:05,376 --> 01:00:06,877
Then...

806
01:00:26,605 --> 01:00:27,692
What is this?

807
01:00:27,693 --> 01:00:29,900
You didn't shroud the corpse
after relocating the grave?

808
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:31,861
Are you planning to burn it entirely?

809
01:00:32,945 --> 01:00:36,032
If the district office finds out
about this, there will be an uproar.

810
01:00:41,181 --> 01:00:42,411
My father's coffin?

811
01:00:42,491 --> 01:00:44,650
Yes, I don't know the reason either.

812
01:00:44,743 --> 01:00:46,959
But they said it has to
be cremated immediately.

813
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:48,627
What does that mean?

814
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:50,753
Hello, ma'am.

815
01:00:50,754 --> 01:00:52,380
We need to act fast.

816
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:56,427
Your father is heading towards
the newborn in the US as we speak.

817
01:01:18,245 --> 01:01:19,860
- I'll cremate him.
- No, wait.

818
01:01:19,933 --> 01:01:22,101
The representative of the bereaved family
hasn't given consent yet, wait a moment.

819
01:01:22,102 --> 01:01:24,273
There's no one answering the
phone at the US residence.

820
01:01:24,274 --> 01:01:27,792
Therefore, you need to give us
permission to cremate him.

821
01:01:48,312 --> 01:01:51,148
Is this really the only way?

822
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:10,162
All right.

823
01:02:10,835 --> 01:02:12,253
Cremate him.

824
01:02:12,332 --> 01:02:13,462
Yes.

825
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,799
Burn it.

826
01:02:39,992 --> 01:02:42,198
Oh dear, what a tragic fate...

827
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:44,443
He won't be able to depart to a good place.

828
01:03:32,177 --> 01:03:38,089
<i> Hitting the road </i>

829
01:03:38,729 --> 01:03:44,595
<i> Hitting the road </i>

830
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:52,311
<i> The beach roses along
Myeongsasimni's shores </i>

831
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:57,900
<i> They wither, their leaves fall,
harbor no sorrow </i>

832
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:03,990
<i> Oh-oh, oh-oh </i>

833
01:04:04,067 --> 01:04:10,037
<i> Oh-oh, oh-oh, hey, oh-ho </i>

834
01:04:10,104 --> 01:04:14,875
<i> Which enlightened being
started it all? </i>

835
01:04:14,965 --> 01:04:19,922
<i> Why did the notion of death
come into existence? </i>

836
01:04:20,007 --> 01:04:25,428
<i> Oh-ho, oh-ho </i>

837
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:30,428
<i> Oh-oh, oh-oh, hey, oh-ho </i>

838
01:04:32,074 --> 01:04:35,146
<i> You've deviated from the route,
restarting the search. </i>

839
01:04:38,352 --> 01:04:40,552
CHAPTER IV: SPIRITUAL RETRIBUTION
(DISTURBED EARTH)

840
01:04:40,553 --> 01:04:42,111
Sang-deok, you know Chang-min, right?

841
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,209
After relocating that grave,

842
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:46,365
he seems to have gotten quite sick.

843
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:49,285
Stop by and see him
when you have time, okay?

844
01:04:49,331 --> 01:04:51,996
<i> Turn left </i>

845
01:04:52,137 --> 01:04:54,268
The hospital can't figure
out what's wrong, either.

846
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:56,625
They just keep doing tests
and draining my wallet.

847
01:04:57,626 --> 01:04:59,286
I have these sinister dreams...

848
01:05:00,654 --> 01:05:02,048
I even see things...

849
01:05:03,382 --> 01:05:04,425
Sang-deok...

850
01:05:07,256 --> 01:05:11,354
I think it's retribution
for having angered a spirit.

851
01:05:11,355 --> 01:05:12,831
It's just that...

852
01:05:12,911 --> 01:05:15,645
Right after the exhumation
that day, I saw something.

853
01:05:16,103 --> 01:05:18,314
It looked strange.

854
01:05:18,773 --> 01:05:19,523
That snake...

855
01:05:20,775 --> 01:05:22,509
What? A snake?

856
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:25,738
Damn it, I should have just ignored it.

857
01:05:26,781 --> 01:05:27,907
Sang-deok.

858
01:05:28,018 --> 01:05:29,667
I want to ask you a favor.

859
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:34,038
Please find that snake cut in half,
and perform a ritual offering for it.

860
01:05:38,241 --> 01:05:40,586
<i> I really didn't want
to go there that day. </i>

861
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:42,213
<i> I truly didn't. </i>

862
01:05:42,713 --> 01:05:43,756
Sang-deok.

863
01:05:44,048 --> 01:05:47,195
Something there felt off from the
very beginning, don't you think so?

864
01:05:47,196 --> 01:05:49,261
Why would there be a grave
in such a place?

865
01:07:34,659 --> 01:07:36,077
Stacked coffins.

866
01:07:36,702 --> 01:07:38,871
Yes... I'm busy now.

867
01:07:38,969 --> 01:07:40,665
I'm studying the Bible with
some people from the church.

868
01:07:40,732 --> 01:07:41,671
50,000 won.

869
01:07:41,745 --> 01:07:43,000
Here you go.

870
01:07:43,099 --> 01:07:44,043
Deal.

871
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:45,252
What?

872
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,867
Stacked coffins?!

873
01:07:48,923 --> 01:07:51,175
Yes, it was right underneath.

874
01:07:51,311 --> 01:07:52,968
But... Elder Go.

875
01:07:53,552 --> 01:07:56,347
Have you ever seen a coffin
standing vertically?

876
01:08:00,295 --> 01:08:01,310
Hello.

877
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:04,730
Professor Hwarim?

878
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,608
Now the V-ups.

879
01:08:07,609 --> 01:08:09,151
In a two-beat rhythm.

880
01:08:22,748 --> 01:08:26,894
When the ground shifts, it does
end up vertically sometimes, but...

881
01:08:28,678 --> 01:08:30,464
Isn't it too big?

882
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:33,175
What's this?

883
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,558
What's that thing?

884
01:08:49,365 --> 01:08:50,151
These...

885
01:08:51,736 --> 01:08:55,280
It seems these were placed to
prevent opening from the outside.

886
01:08:55,656 --> 01:08:57,533
- Or if not...
- If not, what?

887
01:08:57,908 --> 01:09:00,029
Probably the other way around.

888
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:04,361
First, let's pull it out
and have a look.

889
01:09:04,362 --> 01:09:05,955
We're not pulling anything out.

890
01:09:05,956 --> 01:09:08,419
First, the right thing to do
is to inform the chief mourner.

891
01:09:08,419 --> 01:09:10,068
We have to talk about our money as well.

892
01:09:10,135 --> 01:09:11,213
Let's...

893
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:14,507
Let's not meddle with this.

894
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:20,062
Let's pull it out, first.

895
01:09:20,063 --> 01:09:22,250
He has to be a family member.

896
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:25,061
We can't just leave this fellow here.

897
01:09:26,187 --> 01:09:28,397
But this thing, how...

898
01:09:28,516 --> 01:09:30,191
Let's just pull it out, go get the rope.

899
01:09:30,263 --> 01:09:32,193
The sun is setting.

900
01:09:35,493 --> 01:09:37,868
When I say one, two, three, pull hard.

901
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:40,618
One! Two! Three!

902
01:09:55,508 --> 01:09:57,493
Is that even a human's coffin?

903
01:10:46,503 --> 01:10:48,144
Where are we going?

904
01:10:53,952 --> 01:10:55,352
BOGUKSA TEMPLE

905
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:08,998
What is happening?

906
01:11:09,077 --> 01:11:13,127
As I've told you on the phone,
I had to relocate a grave unexpectedly.

907
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:15,588
I will remain indebted to
you for your help today.

908
01:11:17,889 --> 01:11:20,592
The chief mourner said
she's on her way here.

909
01:11:20,593 --> 01:11:24,071
Is there a suitable area
where we could place the coffin?

910
01:11:43,141 --> 01:11:44,508
What on earth...

911
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:47,161
This... what is this?

912
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:53,834
Excuse me, Venerable, but do you
happen to have some glutinous rice?

913
01:12:10,049 --> 01:12:10,890
Bong-gil.

914
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:12,853
Go to the car and bring the horse blood.

915
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,694
You know this can't be anything good.

916
01:12:25,327 --> 01:12:27,222
What do you mean by stacked coffins?

917
01:12:27,223 --> 01:12:29,576
What in the world is that thing?

918
01:12:29,577 --> 01:12:33,541
Please tell us everything you know.

919
01:12:33,662 --> 01:12:35,001
I don't know.

920
01:12:35,459 --> 01:12:38,004
I really don't.

921
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:42,216
I don't know why that thing
was buried there,

922
01:12:42,448 --> 01:12:47,500
and I don't know why my father's grave
was in such a terrible place, either.

923
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:50,725
I saw what was inscribed
on the funeral banner.

924
01:12:51,566 --> 01:12:55,437
"Marquess Park Geun-hyun,
Vice Chairman of the Privy Council."

925
01:12:55,438 --> 01:13:00,483
Your father was infamous for
selling out our country.

926
01:13:00,648 --> 01:13:03,770
So as punishment, that monk
chose for your father the most...

927
01:13:03,836 --> 01:13:05,656
I know!

928
01:13:06,741 --> 01:13:08,659
That's why I don't know anything else.

929
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,913
That monk named Gisune...

930
01:13:14,854 --> 01:13:16,876
He wasn't Korean.

931
01:13:18,294 --> 01:13:20,379
He was Japanese.

932
01:13:20,944 --> 01:13:22,789
- What?!
- He was Japanese?

933
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,126
His name was...

934
01:13:24,127 --> 01:13:26,469
Murayama Junji.

935
01:13:28,471 --> 01:13:33,272
I heard he knew every corner of Joseon's
eight provinces like the back of his hand.

936
01:13:33,273 --> 01:13:38,502
So why would he choose such an ominous burial
site for my father who had been loyal to them?

937
01:13:38,503 --> 01:13:40,807
I just can't wrap my head around it.

938
01:13:44,528 --> 01:13:47,740
I've been notified that the baby
in the US is feeling well.

939
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:51,911
I will prepare the remuneration
that Ji-yong promised to you.

940
01:13:52,244 --> 01:13:54,820
And as for that coffin...

941
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:57,808
Take care of it as you see fit.

942
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,711
<i> As I have learned, the Buddha
spoke of preserving life. </i>

943
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:03,089
<i> To relieve the suffering and illness,
recite this scripture with reverence. </i>

944
01:14:03,089 --> 01:14:06,258
<i> Invoking the spirit of the Wood Dragon
to remove earthly misfortunes. </i>

945
01:14:06,357 --> 01:14:09,679
<i> Seven thousand Buddhas shall
deliver us from life's adversities. </i>

946
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,348
<i> Invoking the spirit of the Wood Tiger
to liberate us from entanglements. </i>

947
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:15,228
<i> Seven thousand Buddhas shall break us
free from mental and spiritual constraints, </i>

948
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:18,645
<i> and through the sexagenary cycle
we shall be guided to deliverance. </i>

949
01:14:23,651 --> 01:14:25,486
Let's burn it right away.

950
01:14:27,321 --> 01:14:28,364
Okay.

951
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:32,568
Let's burn it as soon as dawn breaks.

952
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:35,121
Yes, let's do that, it would
lift a weight off my chest!

953
01:14:35,122 --> 01:14:36,998
For real.

954
01:14:36,998 --> 01:14:37,957
Excuse me...

955
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:41,599
I've boiled some noodles inside,
come in and warm yourselves up.

956
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,256
Oh, yes. We appreciate it.

957
01:14:43,329 --> 01:14:44,956
- All right.
- This way.

958
01:14:45,016 --> 01:14:47,528
Right from the start I had a
bad feeling about that grave.

959
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:48,961
That mountain's shape
just stretches on and on...

960
01:14:48,962 --> 01:14:51,262
Come to think of it,
I haven't eaten all day.

961
01:14:57,627 --> 01:14:58,477
All right.

962
01:14:58,564 --> 01:15:00,396
Please, have a drink.

963
01:15:00,463 --> 01:15:02,494
Thank you.

964
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,859
Thank you, I will enjoy it.

965
01:15:04,966 --> 01:15:06,673
Here's to everyone's good health!

966
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,529
The scent is unmatched!

967
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,347
This is a treasure of a drink.

968
01:15:13,348 --> 01:15:16,838
- Let me pour you a glass, Venerable.
- This is boiling hot.

969
01:15:16,924 --> 01:15:18,271
- Yes.
- I'll pour you a drink.

970
01:15:18,344 --> 01:15:22,676
Do you also have some acorn jelly?
Just kidding, I was trying to be funny.

971
01:15:24,162 --> 01:15:29,102
CHAPTER V: GHOSTLY FIRE
(ONI)

972
01:15:31,288 --> 01:15:33,071
Yes, Murayama Junji.

973
01:15:33,344 --> 01:15:34,680
Don't you remember?

974
01:15:34,818 --> 01:15:37,725
Our teacher used to mention it
from time to time.

975
01:15:37,892 --> 01:15:39,596
In Japan... What was it called...

976
01:15:39,597 --> 01:15:43,939
- A yin-yang master known as The Fox.
- I remember.

977
01:15:44,464 --> 01:15:46,272
The yin-yang master, Murayama.

978
01:15:46,359 --> 01:15:49,028
Teacher said he even met
him once, a long time ago.

979
01:15:49,175 --> 01:15:52,089
He said his spiritual energy was so
overwhelming that he wasn't a human being.

980
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:54,386
That he was, in fact, a fox cub.

981
01:15:54,387 --> 01:15:55,520
But why do you ask?

982
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,535
Where are you now?

983
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:58,245
Nevermind.

984
01:15:58,496 --> 01:15:59,622
All right.

985
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:01,791
Thank you, Gwangshim.

986
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:03,876
Talk to you soon.

987
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:11,842
Grandma.

988
01:16:13,273 --> 01:16:14,679
Grandma.

989
01:16:19,297 --> 01:16:21,394
I feel strange.

990
01:17:19,255 --> 01:17:20,953
He took my liver.

991
01:17:21,059 --> 01:17:22,060
My liver...

992
01:17:22,306 --> 01:17:23,474
My liver...

993
01:17:28,146 --> 01:17:30,254
He took my liver.

994
01:17:30,322 --> 01:17:32,131
Some bastard took my liver.

995
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,761
The bastard took my liver.

996
01:17:33,855 --> 01:17:35,041
He took my liver.

997
01:17:35,114 --> 01:17:36,427
He took my liver.

998
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:37,807
He took my liver.

999
01:17:37,874 --> 01:17:38,758
Where are my clothes?

1000
01:17:38,831 --> 01:17:39,922
Where are my clothes?

1001
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,048
My clothes... my clothes... my clothes...

1002
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:44,727
- Where are my clothes?
- Shit...

1003
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:45,998
Some bastard took my liver.

1004
01:17:46,072 --> 01:17:47,730
My clothes... my liver...

1005
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:48,923
He took my liver.

1006
01:19:42,288 --> 01:19:43,387
Hwarim!

1007
01:19:58,523 --> 01:20:00,488
Damn it.

1008
01:20:09,290 --> 01:20:11,707
Shit, this stench of meat...

1009
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:29,558
Because of the seal,
it pierced through the ceiling.

1010
01:20:32,908 --> 01:20:35,231
This thing... right now...

1011
01:20:37,316 --> 01:20:40,343
What's the matter, you rascal?
Speak!

1012
01:20:42,113 --> 01:20:44,197
This thing, right now it's...

1013
01:20:44,198 --> 01:20:47,208
I think it's in the pigsty
down the valley.

1014
01:20:47,618 --> 01:20:49,203
Wake everyone up.

1015
01:20:49,323 --> 01:20:50,413
Yes.

1016
01:22:08,402 --> 01:22:11,282
The seal has been broken.

1017
01:22:12,782 --> 01:22:16,022
Are there humans here?

1018
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:22,342
I've come to retrieve my helmet.

1019
01:22:22,422 --> 01:22:24,562
Are there humans here?

1020
01:22:25,662 --> 01:22:26,872
No.

1021
01:22:27,682 --> 01:22:29,372
There aren't.

1022
01:22:29,602 --> 01:22:31,632
There are no humans here.

1023
01:22:31,752 --> 01:22:36,402
I'm your subordinate.

1024
01:22:38,042 --> 01:22:40,572
Is that so?

1025
01:22:40,572 --> 01:22:41,792
Then,

1026
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:46,342
did you bring sweetfish or melon?

1027
01:22:49,212 --> 01:22:53,292
Are the words of your Lord
not reaching your ears?

1028
01:22:54,982 --> 01:22:58,482
I've beheaded the enemy commander.

1029
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:08,752
No...

1030
01:23:08,802 --> 01:23:10,302
No...

1031
01:23:10,762 --> 01:23:14,502
I'll prepare the sweetfish for you.

1032
01:23:41,162 --> 01:23:44,192
You're a human.

1033
01:24:05,523 --> 01:24:06,734
Run.

1034
01:24:07,351 --> 01:24:08,185
Bong-gil.

1035
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:44,981
Bong-gil...

1036
01:25:05,582 --> 01:25:07,382
A pagoda.

1037
01:27:17,425 --> 01:27:18,592
Bong-gil...

1038
01:27:18,592 --> 01:27:19,802
Bong-gil.

1039
01:27:20,386 --> 01:27:22,179
Bong-gil! Bong-gil!

1040
01:27:22,179 --> 01:27:23,139
Wake up!

1041
01:27:25,599 --> 01:27:28,894
700,000 won to Kim Young-ja
from the Sunsine Tea House...

1042
01:27:29,437 --> 01:27:31,480
170,000 won at the electronic
appliance store...

1043
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,009
I have to pay 2 million won to the
Thousand Days funeral service company...

1044
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:35,503
Minus 5 million won to the Mirae Asset company...

1045
01:27:35,504 --> 01:27:37,653
Professor, help me!

1046
01:27:38,072 --> 01:27:39,864
Help me!

1047
01:27:41,407 --> 01:27:43,409
Help me!

1048
01:27:43,499 --> 01:27:45,369
Help me...

1049
01:27:45,369 --> 01:27:47,163
Bong-gil, wake up!

1050
01:27:47,163 --> 01:27:49,081
Try to wake up, Bong-gil...

1051
01:28:01,719 --> 01:28:03,387
<i>This morning in Goseong County, Gangwon Province,</i>

1052
01:28:03,387 --> 01:28:05,097
<i>wild bear attacks resulted in casualties...</i>

1053
01:28:05,097 --> 01:28:08,559
The fever still hasn't subsided, so
I will administer a fever reducer.

1054
01:28:08,559 --> 01:28:10,353
<i> At the damaged livestock barn in the village, </i>

1055
01:28:10,353 --> 01:28:13,773
<i> dozens of pigs were found
with their abdomens torn open, </i>

1056
01:28:13,773 --> 01:28:17,777
<i> and two additional bodies were discovered
having suffered the same attack. </i>

1057
01:28:17,777 --> 01:28:19,737
<i>The victims are a monk from a nearby temple,</i>

1058
01:28:19,737 --> 01:28:23,032
<i>and a migrant worker employed
at the livestock barn.</i>

1059
01:28:23,032 --> 01:28:25,976
<i> Officials from the county office stated
that the local government and military units </i>

1060
01:28:25,977 --> 01:28:28,079
<i> are working together to
track down the wild bears. </i>

1061
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:59,193
Forgive me.

1062
01:29:00,325 --> 01:29:03,072
I shouldn't have suggested
pulling him out of there...

1063
01:29:04,073 --> 01:29:05,866
Because of that, Bong-gil...

1064
01:29:07,868 --> 01:29:09,870
And the monk...

1065
01:29:11,573 --> 01:29:16,468
Bong-gil underwent the spiritual affliction
when he was a baseball player and had to quit.

1066
01:29:18,113 --> 01:29:21,415
When he came looking for a teacher
after being abandoned by his family,

1067
01:29:21,972 --> 01:29:24,552
I tried my best to stop him
from becoming a shaman,

1068
01:29:26,854 --> 01:29:29,013
but he said he would be fine
as long as he is with me.

1069
01:29:29,014 --> 01:29:32,226
That he had nothing to fear.

1070
01:29:40,407 --> 01:29:43,462
I was frozen with fear
and I couldn't do anything.

1071
01:29:51,203 --> 01:29:52,788
It left footprints.

1072
01:29:53,549 --> 01:29:55,416
And it had a shadow.

1073
01:29:56,238 --> 01:29:59,478
In shamanism, there's this
widely accepted theory.

1074
01:30:00,424 --> 01:30:05,425
Given that the spirit is incomplete
and lacks a physical form,

1075
01:30:05,426 --> 01:30:11,412
ultimately the body and mind of a
healthy person can never be defeated.

1076
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:16,686
But that thing... is of a
very different nature.

1077
01:30:16,687 --> 01:30:20,766
It's not just any spirit, but
one bound to an object.

1078
01:30:21,442 --> 01:30:22,409
Bound to an object?

1079
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:27,439
It emerges when the spirit becomes attached
to an object and they evolve in tandem.

1080
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:31,619
It's something that should
never exist in our country.

1081
01:30:35,177 --> 01:30:37,625
I couldn't feel anything.

1082
01:30:38,542 --> 01:30:40,411
Neither its identity,

1083
01:30:40,412 --> 01:30:42,566
nor where it came from,

1084
01:30:42,567 --> 01:30:45,299
nor the reason why it dwelled
at the Park family's grave.

1085
01:30:50,596 --> 01:30:53,307
He has many injuries
in the abdominal area.

1086
01:30:53,641 --> 01:30:55,393
He also lost a lot of blood.

1087
01:30:55,768 --> 01:30:59,437
The problem is that his
spine was also affected,

1088
01:30:59,438 --> 01:31:01,691
so let's send him to a larger
hospital right away.

1089
01:31:02,566 --> 01:31:05,194
Since the injuries were caused
by wild animals...

1090
01:31:10,794 --> 01:31:14,397
THE BACKBONE OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA
(BAEKDU-DAEGAN MOUNTAIN RANGE)

1091
01:31:14,398 --> 01:31:17,164
<i>The fox has broken the tiger's spine. </i>

1092
01:31:38,018 --> 01:31:39,624
<i> Grave robbers were rampant in those days, </i>

1093
01:31:39,704 --> 01:31:41,712
<i> so a modest grave was set up for him
in a place unknown to anyone. </i>

1094
01:31:41,713 --> 01:31:46,485
<i> The grave robbers' belongings are still in the storage. </i>

1095
01:32:16,094 --> 01:32:19,268
"Our land, my comrades".

1096
01:32:19,349 --> 01:32:20,561
"Iron Blood Legion"?

1097
01:32:26,817 --> 01:32:29,570
We've managed to prevent organ damage
in a timely manner.

1098
01:32:29,987 --> 01:32:33,052
We will have to conduct
some additional tests,

1099
01:32:33,053 --> 01:32:36,534
but for now, he should have
regained consciousness...

1100
01:32:36,535 --> 01:32:38,204
It's strange.

1101
01:32:38,537 --> 01:32:41,040
What happened to him?

1102
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,477
Fortunately, he's gotten
past the critical point,

1103
01:32:43,478 --> 01:32:45,336
but they said his spine was affected.

1104
01:32:45,336 --> 01:32:46,545
Can he walk?

1105
01:32:46,545 --> 01:32:48,222
He needs to pull through this.

1106
01:32:48,223 --> 01:32:50,090
Nonetheless, he's healthy.

1107
01:32:51,592 --> 01:32:53,671
What in the world have you
been doing lately?

1108
01:32:53,672 --> 01:32:55,054
Tell me.

1109
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:57,848
- Gwangshim.
- Yes.

1110
01:32:57,986 --> 01:33:00,017
He reeks of meat.

1111
01:33:02,656 --> 01:33:04,981
I know, that's why I called you.

1112
01:33:05,404 --> 01:33:08,472
How about we play goblins again?
It's been ages.

1113
01:33:09,473 --> 01:33:11,275
Park Ja-hye, what are you waiting for?

1114
01:33:11,276 --> 01:33:12,363
Lock the door.

1115
01:33:12,392 --> 01:33:18,042

01:33:25,167 --> 01:33:26,669
Park Gil-ho.

1119
01:33:27,207 --> 01:33:28,583
Shin Pal-gyun.

1120
01:33:30,506 --> 01:33:32,049
Kim Jeong-bok.

1121
01:33:32,507 --> 01:33:34,677
Song Jong-ik.

1122
01:33:34,855 --> 01:33:37,263
Min Geun-ho.

1123
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,225
Jeon Tae-hwan, Im Chung-shin.

1124
01:33:42,268 --> 01:33:43,477
That's right.

1125
01:33:43,978 --> 01:33:48,024
<i> They look way too determined,
for them to be mere grave robbers. </i>

1126
01:34:16,498 --> 01:34:19,764
My goodness, ladies! It's been a
while since we've seen each other!

1127
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:21,413
Is everyone here?

1128
01:34:21,486 --> 01:34:23,142
I arrived just now.

1129
01:34:23,285 --> 01:34:25,796
The harvest season is over
and the cold is creeping in,

1130
01:34:25,797 --> 01:34:27,730
so tell me, is everyone all right?

1131
01:34:27,814 --> 01:34:30,669
Oh my, since we've all gathered like this,

1132
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:32,888
I should whip up some pancakes
or something to bring over.

1133
01:34:32,889 --> 01:34:34,571
Don't worry.

1134
01:34:34,651 --> 01:34:38,672
I already brought sorghum rice
cakes and some boiled pork.

1135
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:42,452
I was really wondering where this
delicious smell was coming from...

1136
01:34:42,453 --> 01:34:43,824
I hope you brought enough.

1137
01:34:43,825 --> 01:34:46,457
Yes, she brought plenty!

1138
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:48,571
Even if we eat our fill,
there will still be some left.

1139
01:34:48,572 --> 01:34:52,560
Then why don't we invite over Mr. Jang from
across the street, and Mr. Je-cheon as well?

1140
01:34:52,561 --> 01:34:54,727
Why bother inviting busy people over?

1141
01:34:54,728 --> 01:34:56,737
Let's just eat quietly
among ourselves.

1142
01:34:56,738 --> 01:34:59,205
That's right, let's just
eat among ourselves.

1143
01:34:59,206 --> 01:35:01,789
Did you also bring some sweetfish?

1144
01:35:07,063 --> 01:35:07,937
What's this?

1145
01:35:08,366 --> 01:35:10,543
I think Mr. Yoon has arrived!

1146
01:35:10,544 --> 01:35:12,400
What are you talking about?

1147
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:14,253
Haven't you heard that Mr. Yoon
is working late tonight?

1148
01:35:14,254 --> 01:35:17,863
That's right, there's no way
Mr. Yoon could have come.

1149
01:35:17,863 --> 01:35:19,632
What is everyone talking about?

1150
01:35:19,633 --> 01:35:20,777
Just tell us already!

1151
01:35:20,864 --> 01:35:22,618
Don't talk to him.

1152
01:35:23,285 --> 01:35:26,427
I heard he had an encounter with
something extremely dangerous.

1153
01:35:26,428 --> 01:35:30,712
How dangerous could it have been,
to have him bedridden like this?

1154
01:35:30,805 --> 01:35:31,711
Haven't you heard?

1155
01:35:32,984 --> 01:35:36,048
They say he met a spiritual
guest last night.

1156
01:35:37,172 --> 01:35:39,952
What nonsense are you even spouting?

1157
01:35:40,799 --> 01:35:43,305
Goodness gracious... Mr. Yoon?!

1158
01:35:43,522 --> 01:35:46,474
What did you see that's
got you scared stiff in bed?

1159
01:35:47,181 --> 01:35:48,527
No way!

1160
01:35:48,528 --> 01:35:51,421
This guy looks completely healthy to me.

1161
01:35:51,856 --> 01:35:53,524
Who was it?

1162
01:35:54,275 --> 01:35:56,694
The spiritual guest you met.

1163
01:35:57,153 --> 01:35:58,738
Tell me already.

1164
01:36:01,449 --> 01:36:04,493
My master.

1165
01:36:05,652 --> 01:36:07,038
Your master?

1166
01:36:07,788 --> 01:36:09,123
What kind of master?

1167
01:36:15,848 --> 01:36:18,924
Speak, you scoundrel.

1168
01:36:26,192 --> 01:36:31,752
My master killed 10,000 people
and became a divine entity.

1169
01:36:36,072 --> 01:36:38,092
That master of yours...

1170
01:36:39,302 --> 01:36:41,872
Where is he now?

1171
01:37:02,242 --> 01:37:05,582
38.3417° - 128.3189°

1172
01:37:05,822 --> 01:37:09,712
38.3417° - 128.3189°

1173
01:37:09,952 --> 01:37:13,402
38.3417° - 128.3189°

1174
01:37:15,518 --> 01:37:16,857
Cherry blossoms...

1175
01:37:18,382 --> 01:37:23,762
He is the general who guards that place.

1176
01:37:39,389 --> 01:37:40,840
What the hell?

1177
01:37:43,762 --> 01:37:44,952
Master!

1178
01:37:44,952 --> 01:37:47,122
Grace me with your attention!

1179
01:37:47,142 --> 01:37:49,482
Here I am,

1180
01:37:49,532 --> 01:37:53,292
willing to serve as your vessel!

1181
01:38:06,411 --> 01:38:09,327
I'll wrench that piece of flesh from you.

1182
01:38:10,919 --> 01:38:12,204
Ja-hye...

1183
01:38:12,997 --> 01:38:14,665
Come here.

1184
01:38:15,124 --> 01:38:17,043
Please, save me, Ja-hye...

1185
01:38:23,303 --> 01:38:25,843
Filthy whores.

1186
01:38:25,956 --> 01:38:27,707
You will all die.

1187
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:43,284
Hwarim, stay out of this.

1188
01:38:43,364 --> 01:38:44,704
It's a Japanese ghost.

1189
01:38:44,778 --> 01:38:46,113
I know.

1190
01:38:46,196 --> 01:38:48,757
These spirits will kill you even if
you have no connections to them.

1191
01:38:48,758 --> 01:38:51,535
They kill anyone who merely approaches.

1192
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:54,412
Haven't you seen it with your
own eyes in Japan, back then?

1193
01:38:54,413 --> 01:38:56,582
Don't go even near them!

1194
01:38:57,875 --> 01:39:00,211
Even if your grandmother is by your side,

1195
01:39:01,128 --> 01:39:02,855
you mustn't get involved.

1196
01:39:02,911 --> 01:39:04,131
Let's go, Ja-hye.

1197
01:39:04,423 --> 01:39:05,924
Then what about Bong-gil?

1198
01:39:09,053 --> 01:39:10,179
I'll give you a call.

1199
01:39:10,282 --> 01:39:11,055
Let's go.

1200
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:28,322
Is that thing down there?

1201
01:39:29,949 --> 01:39:32,618
That means it has returned
to its original place.

1202
01:39:33,411 --> 01:39:35,371
But why did you go back there?

1203
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:36,038
Well?

1204
01:39:37,259 --> 01:39:38,124
Well?!

1205
01:39:38,259 --> 01:39:41,127
Park Ji-yong said something
before he died.

1206
01:39:42,628 --> 01:39:44,964
"The fox has broken the tiger's spine."

1207
01:39:46,549 --> 01:39:48,676
What does that mean?

1208
01:39:48,884 --> 01:39:51,048
In feng shui,

1209
01:39:51,049 --> 01:39:54,222
our country is seen as having
the shape of a tiger.

1210
01:39:54,223 --> 01:39:56,350
A tiger holding the continent in its grip.

1211
01:39:56,684 --> 01:39:57,476
So?

1212
01:39:57,572 --> 01:39:59,948
The numbers engraved on the
back of that gravestone.

1213
01:40:00,028 --> 01:40:01,564
Latitude and longitude!

1214
01:40:01,663 --> 01:40:03,167
Where do you think that place is?

1215
01:40:03,168 --> 01:40:05,235
Exactly, right there.

1216
01:40:05,236 --> 01:40:07,379
Right atop the tiger's spine.

1217
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:10,447
That yin-yang master known as The Fox,
whom Hwarim mentioned...

1218
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:12,825
That fox cub...

1219
01:40:13,993 --> 01:40:15,661
He went there, and...

1220
01:40:15,995 --> 01:40:18,664
Drove an iron stake into the ground.

1221
01:40:23,234 --> 01:40:25,588
Then why was the Park family's
grave on top of it?

1222
01:40:27,936 --> 01:40:30,045
These determined-looking people

1223
01:40:30,046 --> 01:40:32,452
were constantly searching for and
extracting such stakes from the ground,

1224
01:40:32,453 --> 01:40:35,255
so he covered it with the grave of a
high-ranking official from that era,

1225
01:40:35,256 --> 01:40:36,658
to prevent anyone from approaching it.

1226
01:40:36,659 --> 01:40:37,558
Then...

1227
01:40:37,558 --> 01:40:40,018
Why does a spirit dwell there?

1228
01:40:40,186 --> 01:40:41,187
Well?

1229
01:40:43,702 --> 01:40:46,722
<i> He is the general who guards that place. </i>

1230
01:40:46,752 --> 01:40:48,912
<i> My master. </i>

1231
01:40:53,662 --> 01:40:57,692
<i> 38.3417° - 128.3189° </i>

1232
01:40:58,249 --> 01:40:59,455
Perhaps...

1233
01:41:00,414 --> 01:41:02,500
He's there to protect that iron stake.

1234
01:41:17,205 --> 01:41:18,485
Lee Hwarim...

1235
01:41:18,552 --> 01:41:21,602
Though we have a business relationship,

1236
01:41:22,436 --> 01:41:24,619
- let me ask you a favor that won't cost a thing.
- Hold on.

1237
01:41:24,699 --> 01:41:26,795
If you're harboring some absurd ideas,
don't even mention them.

1238
01:41:26,796 --> 01:41:27,869
So they crushed the national spirit

1239
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:30,580
and split the country by driving
iron stakes into the ground?

1240
01:41:30,581 --> 01:41:32,096
Do you still believe in these things?

1241
01:41:32,183 --> 01:41:34,657
Those iron stakes at the temple are all for land surveying!

1242
01:41:34,709 --> 01:41:36,075
You know that too!

1243
01:41:36,222 --> 01:41:39,036
Even the academic conferences have
stated that 99% of them are fakes.

1244
01:41:39,109 --> 01:41:40,777
And the remaining 1%?

1245
01:41:42,081 --> 01:41:44,375
- Elder Go.
- What is it?

1246
01:41:44,495 --> 01:41:46,460
This isn't just an ordinary grave.

1247
01:41:46,594 --> 01:41:48,879
There's something meticulously
calculated about it!

1248
01:41:50,578 --> 01:41:54,069
Not long ago, you witnessed people
dying because of that grave.

1249
01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:56,071
Do you want to see that happen again?

1250
01:41:56,072 --> 01:41:57,013
Sang-deok.

1251
01:41:57,013 --> 01:41:59,058
Regardless of where that
iron stake was driven,

1252
01:41:59,059 --> 01:42:02,382
we've lived just fine until now,
without any issues!

1253
01:42:02,383 --> 01:42:04,061
So what's gotten into you all of a sudden?

1254
01:42:04,166 --> 01:42:05,229
That's right.

1255
01:42:05,896 --> 01:42:07,398
You and I,

1256
01:42:07,592 --> 01:42:11,692
we sold land to wealthy people
and have lived well from it since.

1257
01:42:11,693 --> 01:42:13,069
And that's exactly why!

1258
01:42:13,070 --> 01:42:15,489
Elder Go, it's land we're
talking about here, land!

1259
01:42:16,895 --> 01:42:20,327
The very land our future grandchildren
will tread upon and live their lives!

1260
01:42:20,328 --> 01:42:22,997
And you, and I, and all of us!

1261
01:42:23,243 --> 01:42:25,333
And those who come after us.

1262
01:42:28,711 --> 01:42:31,131
Hwarim, you said it's a spirit
bound to an object.

1263
01:42:31,132 --> 01:42:33,702
If that spirit is indeed
bound to the iron stake,

1264
01:42:33,703 --> 01:42:36,154
doesn't it mean we simply
need to remove the stake?

1265
01:42:36,218 --> 01:42:39,597
And once we get rid of that stake,
Bong-gil might also get better!

1266
01:42:43,267 --> 01:42:44,352
Gosh...

1267
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:48,830
But you said the general, or
whatever it is, is clinging to it!

1268
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:50,650
So how are we going to pull it out?

1269
01:42:50,815 --> 01:42:52,485
You've seen that thing at the temple, too.

1270
01:42:52,485 --> 01:42:54,195
The mere thought...

1271
01:42:55,321 --> 01:42:57,448
<i> Lure it like a beast, </i>

1272
01:42:59,617 --> 01:43:01,911
<i> and speak to the spirit. </i>

1273
01:43:04,255 --> 01:43:06,457
<i> Do you really believe we can do this? </i>

1274
01:43:06,566 --> 01:43:08,082
Some things are within our power,

1275
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:10,961
- while some aren't!
- I'm sorry, but that spirit...

1276
01:43:11,556 --> 01:43:13,772
It's not something we can get rid of.

1277
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,216
Even if it doesn't hold grudges,

1278
01:43:16,217 --> 01:43:18,680
it kills everyone who approaches it.

1279
01:43:18,761 --> 01:43:20,429
It's a Japanese ghost.

1280
01:43:21,833 --> 01:43:22,973
But...

1281
01:43:23,086 --> 01:43:25,142
Although we can't get rid of it,

1282
01:43:27,852 --> 01:43:30,038
I can make it come out
for a short while.

1283
01:43:31,107 --> 01:43:33,750
I can buy us some time.

1284
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:43,619
Bong-gil!

1285
01:43:46,641 --> 01:43:49,000
I need more betadine, please.

1286
01:43:49,170 --> 01:43:51,752
I'll sterilize the area again with saline
solution before applying the bandage.

1287
01:43:51,753 --> 01:43:52,753
All right.

1288
01:43:53,421 --> 01:43:54,714
Hold on a second.

1289
01:43:59,802 --> 01:44:02,387
That bastard avoided the tattoos!?

1290
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:04,598
What kind of tattoo is this?

1291
01:44:05,808 --> 01:44:07,476
A scripture to ward off evil spirits.

1292
01:44:32,328 --> 01:44:34,003
Excuse me.

1293
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:37,465
There have been victims in the
vicinity due to wild animals, so...

1294
01:44:39,633 --> 01:44:41,719
Oh, I...

1295
01:44:41,969 --> 01:44:43,679
Where...

1296
01:44:44,055 --> 01:44:46,307
Where are you heading to?

1297
01:44:46,442 --> 01:44:48,392
Oh... Well...

1298
01:44:48,930 --> 01:44:52,146
We’ve come to tidy up
the gravesite up there.

1299
01:44:52,258 --> 01:44:53,384
Ah, yes...

1300
01:44:53,522 --> 01:44:57,693
We've been searching that mountain with
the military for the past few days.

1301
01:44:57,752 --> 01:44:59,147
Oh, we...

1302
01:44:59,247 --> 01:45:00,863
We'll head up there right away,

1303
01:45:00,933 --> 01:45:02,615
and return as soon as the job is done.

1304
01:45:02,674 --> 01:45:03,824
Oh, I see...

1305
01:45:04,116 --> 01:45:05,076
Clear the way for them.

1306
01:46:02,049 --> 01:46:04,613
We're heading back.
Returning to base.

1307
01:46:04,614 --> 01:46:06,239
Since we've given him
what he wanted,

1308
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:08,889
he'll likely make a move
at around 2 o'clock.

1309
01:46:09,345 --> 01:46:12,101
If I can lure him to the yew tree,

1310
01:46:12,216 --> 01:46:14,770
I'll buy us as much time as possible.

1311
01:46:15,271 --> 01:46:17,982
We'll pull out the iron stake right away,

1312
01:46:18,149 --> 01:46:20,443
so hang in there for just 30 minutes.

1313
01:46:20,588 --> 01:46:21,694
And you two...

1314
01:46:21,695 --> 01:46:22,945
After you pull out the iron stake,

1315
01:46:25,981 --> 01:46:29,568
I'll cleanse it with this horse
blood, then I'll dispose of it.

1316
01:46:31,078 --> 01:46:32,288
Professor Kim.

1317
01:46:33,122 --> 01:46:34,832
That iron stake...

1318
01:46:36,042 --> 01:46:37,868
Are you sure it's there?

1319
01:46:41,047 --> 01:46:42,673
One hundred percent.

1320
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:51,474
Gwangshim.

1321
01:46:51,585 --> 01:46:53,476
Please look after Bong-gil today.

1322
01:46:53,626 --> 01:46:56,270
If things go south,
he will be in danger.

1323
01:47:17,541 --> 01:47:18,751
Stop staring.

1324
01:47:19,305 --> 01:47:21,170
She said he'll come out
at around 2 o'clock.

1325
01:47:33,891 --> 01:47:35,226
Elder Go.

1326
01:47:35,643 --> 01:47:38,441
In any case, thank you
for accompanying me.

1327
01:47:38,527 --> 01:47:40,137
"Though one may be overpowered,

1328
01:47:40,211 --> 01:47:42,692
two can defend themselves,

1329
01:47:42,853 --> 01:47:45,346
for a cord of three strands
is not quickly broken."

1330
01:47:46,137 --> 01:47:48,438
Ecclesiastes 4:12.

1331
01:47:50,574 --> 01:47:51,659
Amen.

1332
01:48:08,927 --> 01:48:10,094
Gwangshim.

1333
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:13,128
I hope we won't have to sacrifice it.

1334
01:48:14,682 --> 01:48:17,059
It will die in Bong-gil's place.

1335
01:48:18,894 --> 01:48:22,956
But you love eating fried chicken
at Kyochon, so what's the issue?

1336
01:51:23,432 --> 01:51:26,832
Have you eaten your fill?

1337
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:44,350
This side.

1338
01:51:56,522 --> 01:51:59,782
May I ask who's there?

1339
01:52:03,852 --> 01:52:07,702
My mountain is disturbed.

1340
01:52:10,982 --> 01:52:15,562
Is this your mountain?

1341
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:20,500
That's exactly so.
This is my mountain.

1342
01:52:21,272 --> 01:52:25,292
What's the deal with
this damned old tree?

1343
01:52:25,322 --> 01:52:30,382
But why don't I hear gunshots
or the clash of swords?

1344
01:52:30,432 --> 01:52:32,872
Those are things of the past.

1345
01:52:33,432 --> 01:52:35,282
The war is long over.

1346
01:52:35,292 --> 01:52:37,032
No!

1347
01:52:37,052 --> 01:52:41,302
Our war is not yet over!

1348
01:52:52,152 --> 01:52:56,722
What binds you to this place?

1349
01:52:58,892 --> 01:53:04,322
Originally, I was enshrined
at the Daitoku Temple,

1350
01:53:04,382 --> 01:53:09,702
but that cunning fox, instead of taking me
to the Namsan Shrine, he brought me here!

1351
01:53:11,182 --> 01:53:14,092
Gatahito's sons must have
ordered him to do so.

1352
01:53:14,122 --> 01:53:17,372
Or maybe it was Makoto's doing...

1353
01:53:25,692 --> 01:53:28,262
This is now a peaceful land.

1354
01:53:28,272 --> 01:53:30,942
You have no reason to be here anymore.

1355
01:53:34,202 --> 01:53:35,302
You're wrong.

1356
01:53:35,362 --> 01:53:37,062
You're wrong!

1357
01:53:37,062 --> 01:53:40,802
We must keep heading north.

1358
01:53:40,802 --> 01:53:43,932
Lift your silver guns and swords
and keep moving forward!

1359
01:53:43,952 --> 01:53:44,962
To the north.

1360
01:53:45,062 --> 01:53:46,442
To the north!

1361
01:53:46,492 --> 01:53:51,562
The valiant centipede knows not of retreat!

1362
01:53:58,616 --> 01:53:59,568
What is this?

1363
01:53:59,819 --> 01:54:01,404
Nothing turns up.

1364
01:54:01,478 --> 01:54:03,197
Damn it.

1365
01:54:06,402 --> 01:54:08,902
As the owner of this domain,
I shall ask again.

1366
01:54:09,642 --> 01:54:12,112
How long have you been here?

1367
01:54:13,112 --> 01:54:16,422
Show proper courtesy!

1368
01:54:16,432 --> 01:54:20,742
I am the one to be feared.

1369
01:54:20,752 --> 01:54:22,352
This is my domain!

1370
01:54:22,352 --> 01:54:25,472
I shall ask again!
What exactly are you?

1371
01:54:32,072 --> 01:54:33,366
There's nothing here.

1372
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:34,729
Nothing!

1373
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:37,549
There's nothing here!

1374
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:39,691
You said you were one
hundred percent sure!

1375
01:54:47,388 --> 01:54:48,701
Shit!

1376
01:54:48,781 --> 01:54:49,994
Damn it!

1377
01:54:50,442 --> 01:54:52,462
Heed my words.

1378
01:54:53,592 --> 01:55:00,282
Though the enemy beheaded me at Sekigahara,
I've already conquered my physical form.

1379
01:55:00,352 --> 01:55:03,102
I am the God of War!

1380
01:55:03,102 --> 01:55:08,142
He is the eternal master who
never decays, the blazing sword!

1381
01:55:08,143 --> 01:55:11,382
38.3417° - 128.3189°

1382
01:55:11,712 --> 01:55:18,432
That fox put a spell on me,
I must guard this place!

1383
01:55:29,822 --> 01:55:33,152
Have you taken command of someone?

1384
01:55:34,522 --> 01:55:38,912
Set free the human you're controlling!

1385
01:55:38,912 --> 01:55:40,642
Hurry!

1386
01:55:40,712 --> 01:55:42,342
Please!

1387
01:55:51,212 --> 01:55:53,072
A human!

1388
01:55:53,712 --> 01:55:55,452
March forth!

1389
01:55:56,382 --> 01:55:58,202
March forth!

1390
01:55:58,912 --> 01:56:00,572
March forth!

1391
01:56:02,442 --> 01:56:04,092
March forth!

1392
01:56:14,102 --> 01:56:16,732
That old hag!

1393
01:56:47,028 --> 01:56:48,779
- Have you found it?
- No.

1394
01:56:48,779 --> 01:56:50,406
- There's nothing there!
- What do you mean?

1395
01:56:50,406 --> 01:56:51,460
There's nothing there!

1396
01:56:51,533 --> 01:56:52,700
We must leave right away!

1397
01:57:09,865 --> 01:57:10,968
Sang-deok.

1398
01:57:14,388 --> 01:57:15,723
It's not possible.

1399
01:57:15,842 --> 01:57:17,183
It's not possible!

1400
01:57:29,722 --> 01:57:32,942
38.3417° - 128.3189°

1401
01:57:32,962 --> 01:57:36,472
Please return, my Lord!

1402
01:57:36,512 --> 01:57:40,632
38.3417° - 128.3189°

1403
01:57:40,665 --> 01:57:42,625
Kim Sang-deok!

1404
01:57:55,187 --> 01:57:56,011
Sang-deok!

1405
01:57:56,263 --> 01:57:57,723
Get out of there quickly!

1406
01:58:11,326 --> 01:58:13,298
<i> Then why does a spirit dwell there? </i>

1407
01:58:13,385 --> 01:58:15,244
<i> He said he's the general who guards that place. </i>

1408
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:17,171
<i> That means it has returned
to its original place. </i>

1409
01:58:17,231 --> 01:58:19,370
<i> Have you ever seen a coffin
standing vertically? </i>

1410
01:58:23,562 --> 01:58:24,917
<i> It's fire. </i>

1411
01:58:25,876 --> 01:58:28,921
<i> That fire goes into the earth. </i>

1412
01:58:30,006 --> 01:58:30,965
Get out of there!

1413
01:58:46,462 --> 01:58:48,472
Will you become my subordinate?

1414
01:58:50,842 --> 01:58:52,672
If not...

1415
01:58:53,372 --> 01:58:56,352
Will you offer me your liver?

1416
01:59:00,082 --> 01:59:05,022
I memorized the full text of the
Diamond Sutra inscribed on your body.

1417
01:59:05,722 --> 01:59:07,582
It's been over 500 years!

1418
01:59:10,656 --> 01:59:12,673
The iron stuck in the ground...

1419
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:16,302
And the fire protecting that place.

1420
01:59:17,392 --> 01:59:19,302
The liver...

1421
01:59:20,302 --> 01:59:22,862
Please consume it!

1422
01:59:22,872 --> 01:59:24,912
That fresh liver...

1423
01:59:31,317 --> 01:59:32,810
Horse blood! The horse blood!

1424
01:59:46,822 --> 01:59:48,672
White horse blood...

1425
01:59:50,282 --> 01:59:51,472
It burns!

1426
01:59:57,102 --> 01:59:59,582
Please get back inside, my Lord!

1427
01:59:59,682 --> 02:00:03,532
You mustn't get caught again.

1428
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:08,835
<i> It's a spirit bound to an object. </i>

1429
02:00:08,836 --> 02:00:13,234
<i> The spirit becomes attached to an
object and they evolve in tandem. </i>

1430
02:00:16,362 --> 02:00:17,446
That's right.

1431
02:00:17,863 --> 02:00:19,281
It's iron.

1432
02:00:20,927 --> 02:00:24,537
You yourself are the burning iron.

1433
02:00:30,793 --> 02:00:31,877
Sang-deok!

1434
02:00:32,169 --> 02:00:33,963
- Sang-deok!
- Wake up!

1435
02:00:34,041 --> 02:00:35,789
Lift him onto your back,
we have to leave right away.

1436
02:01:34,690 --> 02:01:36,359
It's earth...

1437
02:01:38,444 --> 02:01:40,621
And the tree's wood.

1438
02:01:41,238 --> 02:01:46,183
Above the earth's energy, the elements
of fire, water, wood and metal...

1439
02:01:46,184 --> 02:01:48,428
They complete the cycle
of the four seasons.

1440
02:01:53,084 --> 02:01:56,419
Fire and water are polar opposites.

1441
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:59,298
Metal and wood are also polar opposites.

1442
02:02:08,015 --> 02:02:09,183
It's done!

1443
02:02:27,994 --> 02:02:30,579
Burning metal...

1444
02:02:32,206 --> 02:02:34,466
Its polar opposite is...

1445
02:02:35,292 --> 02:02:37,378
Soaked wood.

1446
02:02:47,513 --> 02:02:50,357
Water quenches fire...

1447
02:02:58,065 --> 02:02:59,700
And the soaked wood...

1448
02:03:02,361 --> 02:03:04,455
...withstands the metal!

1449
02:03:19,953 --> 02:03:21,130
Gwangshim, wait a minute!

1450
02:03:22,230 --> 02:03:23,457
The blood is black.

1451
02:03:45,321 --> 02:03:48,157
Now... for the last...

1452
02:04:33,077 --> 02:04:34,120
Bong-gil, are you all right?

1453
02:04:42,128 --> 02:04:43,713
Sang-deok...

1454
02:04:43,713 --> 02:04:45,548
- What should we do...
- Professor...

1455
02:04:45,606 --> 02:04:47,216
What should we do?

1456
02:04:47,216 --> 02:04:49,343
This...

1457
02:04:50,928 --> 02:04:53,022
<i> I'm on the brink of death. </i>

1458
02:04:53,514 --> 02:04:56,350
<i> Fortunately, it doesn't hurt that much. </i>

1459
02:04:56,350 --> 02:04:58,060
Hey, Kim Sang-deok!

1460
02:04:58,060 --> 02:04:59,520
Stay with us!

1461
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,857
<i> I have always lived close to death. </i>

1462
02:05:04,942 --> 02:05:05,943
<i> That's right. </i>

1463
02:05:06,402 --> 02:05:10,031
<i> This time, it's simply my turn. </i>
- 200 joules.

1464
02:05:12,491 --> 02:05:15,745
<i> Death means returning to the earth. </i>

1465
02:05:17,413 --> 02:05:19,832
<i> Peacefully... </i>

1466
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:23,169
<i> Ah, wait a minute. </i>

1467
02:05:23,502 --> 02:05:25,061
<i> My daughter's wedding. </i>

1468
02:05:25,288 --> 02:05:28,007
<i> Please, Lord, give him the strength
to get through the surgery. </i>

1469
02:05:28,233 --> 02:05:30,718
<i> Embrace him in the precious
blood of our Savior. </i>

1470
02:05:40,799 --> 02:05:43,172
<i> Over several days, some
people have passed away, </i>

1471
02:05:43,173 --> 02:05:45,398
<i> while others have been
gravely injured. </i>

1472
02:05:45,399 --> 02:05:47,837
<i> The surveillance camera footage was obtained
following a tip-off from a village resident... </i>

1473
02:05:47,838 --> 02:05:50,196
<i> After a long search, the soldiers </i>

1474
02:05:50,196 --> 02:05:53,532
<i> finally managed to capture a wild bear alive. </i>

1475
02:05:54,492 --> 02:05:58,829
<i> The deliberation over saving or sacrificing
the innocent bear has sparked a heated debate. </i>

1476
02:05:58,829 --> 02:06:01,040
<i> Public opinion is fiercely divided. </i>

1477
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:04,085
<i> Initially, the plan involved sacrificing the
bear to ensure the safety of the residents, but... </i>

1478
02:06:04,085 --> 02:06:05,711
Oh...

1479
02:06:05,711 --> 02:06:06,671
He's awake.

1480
02:06:08,422 --> 02:06:09,590
Sang-deok!

1481
02:06:10,341 --> 02:06:11,717
Are you feeling better?

1482
02:06:11,717 --> 02:06:12,510
Yes?

1483
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:17,014
<i> Fortunately, Professor Kim
recovered quickly for his age. </i>

1484
02:06:18,516 --> 02:06:20,601
<i> And Bong-gil... </i>

1485
02:06:21,018 --> 02:06:21,936
<i> Well... </i>

1486
02:06:21,936 --> 02:06:24,029
Oh, we've been busted.

1487
02:06:24,329 --> 02:06:26,107
Are you kidding me?

1488
02:06:27,012 --> 02:06:28,386
This is our food!

1489
02:06:28,473 --> 02:06:30,611
- So you're eating without me?
- Fine, have some.

1490
02:06:30,611 --> 02:06:31,612
I'll grab a slice.

1491
02:06:31,612 --> 02:06:33,342
Gonna enjoy this.

1492
02:06:44,291 --> 02:06:46,293
What is this, a restaurant?

1493
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:48,462
Do you come here every day just to eat?

1494
02:06:48,462 --> 02:06:50,256
Do you think I eat because I want to?

1495
02:06:50,256 --> 02:06:52,591
They force me to eat!
Because it's delicious.

1496
02:06:52,759 --> 02:06:53,759
It really is.

1497
02:06:53,915 --> 02:06:55,553
He's fasting, can't be helped.

1498
02:06:55,553 --> 02:06:57,813
Well, at least someone's
got to eat to stay alive.

1499
02:06:57,814 --> 02:07:00,924
Sang-deok, take this as an
opportunity to lose some weight.

1500
02:07:07,389 --> 02:07:09,191
<i> Winter has passed, </i>

1501
02:07:09,191 --> 02:07:11,485
<i> and everyone returned to their daily lives. </i>

1502
02:07:14,071 --> 02:07:15,363
<i> As if nothing had ever happened. </i>

1503
02:07:15,364 --> 02:07:17,116
Let's go!

1504
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:45,019
<i> In this world, I dwell but briefly </i>

1505
02:07:45,090 --> 02:07:53,526
<i> Singing hymns till daylight fades </i>

1506
02:07:53,527 --> 02:07:56,371
<i> Should You call me, Lord, I'll answer </i>

1507
02:07:56,372 --> 02:08:01,619
<i> Marching forth to glory's shades </i>

1508
02:08:01,619 --> 02:08:03,208
<i> Heaven's gates stand wide before me... </i>

1509
02:08:03,275 --> 02:08:06,565
I clearly told them it needs to be
positioned in alignment with the sun.

1510
02:08:06,566 --> 02:08:09,910
Merely facing it southward does
not make it auspicious by default.

1511
02:08:09,911 --> 02:08:11,761
Then what should we do?

1512
02:08:22,028 --> 02:08:23,099
Next up...

1513
02:08:23,168 --> 02:08:26,215
The groom and bride
will bow to each other.

1514
02:08:26,216 --> 02:08:28,062
The groom and bride will now greet.

1515
02:08:38,833 --> 02:08:42,368
Next up, the family members and close
friends of the bride and groom will gather

1516
02:08:42,368 --> 02:08:43,869
- for the photo session.
- Hey.

1517
02:08:43,869 --> 02:08:46,241
- Elder Go!
- Please come forward.

1518
02:08:46,242 --> 02:08:47,498
Hey, come here.

1519
02:08:48,365 --> 02:08:51,377
Why would we squeeze in with
the close relatives? Forget it!

1520
02:08:54,088 --> 02:08:55,798
Let's just take one photo.

1521
02:08:55,798 --> 02:08:57,425
Let's go and take just one photo.

1522
02:08:57,467 --> 02:09:00,886
- We're like family at this point.
- But it's a family photograph...

1523
02:09:03,878 --> 02:09:05,516
The tall person in the middle,

1524
02:09:05,516 --> 02:09:07,351
please step back a bit.

1525
02:09:07,351 --> 02:09:09,061
The person on the left wearing glasses,

1526
02:09:09,061 --> 02:09:10,646
please move in a little closer.

1527
02:09:10,646 --> 02:09:11,605
Yes.

1528
02:09:12,323 --> 02:09:14,975
Both the father and the daughter
sporting bellies...

1529
02:09:14,976 --> 02:09:17,334
What on earth is this?
For goodness' sake.

1530
02:09:17,335 --> 02:09:18,821
All right, we'll take the photo.

1531
02:09:20,049 --> 02:09:21,032
Father of the bride...

1532
02:09:21,112 --> 02:09:23,022
Look straight ahead.

1533
02:09:23,089 --> 02:09:25,244
Yes, thank you all for your patience.

1534
02:09:26,054 --> 02:09:27,621
Now, everyone, smile together.

1535
02:09:28,622 --> 02:09:31,625
One, two, three!

1536
02:09:31,626 --> 02:09:34,626
EXHUMA

1537
02:09:38,028 --> 02:09:41,522
Choi Min-sik

1538
02:09:43,529 --> 02:09:46,823
Kim Go-eun

1539
02:09:48,425 --> 02:09:50,825
Yoo Hae-jin
